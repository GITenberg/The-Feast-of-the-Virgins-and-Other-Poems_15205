<h3>PREFACE</h3>

<p>At odd hours during an active and busy life I have dallied with the
Muses. I found in them, in earlier years, rest from toil and drudgery
and, later, relief from physical suffering.</p>

<p>Broken by over-work and compelled to abandon the practice of my
profession&mdash;the law, I wrote <i>Pauline</i> after I had been given up to die
by my physicians. It proved to be a better 'medicine' for me than all
the quackeries of the quacks. It diverted my mind from myself and,
perhaps, saved my life. When published, its reception by the best
journals of this country and England was so flattering and, at the same
time, the criticisms of some were so just, that I have been induced to
carefully revise the poem and to publish my re-touched <i>Pauline</i> in this
volume. I hope and believe I have greatly improved it. Several of the
minor poems have been published heretofore in journals and magazines;
others of equal or greater age flap their wings herein for the first
time; a few peeped from the shell but yesterday.</p>

<p>I am aware that this volume contains several poems that a certain class
of critics will condemn, but they are my &quot;chicks&quot; and I will gather them
under my wings.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;None but an author knows an author's cares,<br /></span>
<span>Or Fancy's fondness for the child she bears.&quot;&mdash;<i>Cowper.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Much of my life has been spent in the Northwest&mdash;on the frontier of
civilization, and I became personally acquainted with many of the chiefs
and braves of the Dakota and Ojibway (Chippewa) Indians. I have written
of them largely from my own personal knowledge, and endeavored, above
all things, to be accurate, and to present them true to the life.</p>

<p>For several years I devoted my leisure hours to the study of the
language, history, traditions, customs and superstitions of the Dakotas.
These Indians are now commonly called the &quot;<i>Sioux</i>&quot;&mdash;a name given them
by the early French traders and <i>voyageurs</i>. &quot;Dakota&quot; signifies
<i>alliance</i> or <i>confederation</i>. Many separate bands, all having a common
origin and speaking a common tongue, were united under this name. See
&quot;<i>Tah-Koo Wah-Kan,</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>The Gospel Among the Dakotas,</i>&quot; by Stephen R.
Riggs, pp. 1 to 6 inc.</p>

<p>They were but yesterday the occupants and owners of the fair forests and
fertile prairies of Minnesota&mdash;a brave, hospitable and generous
people&mdash;barbarians, indeed, but noble in their barbarism. They may be
fitly called the Iroquois of the West. In form and features, in language
and traditions, they are distinct from all other Indian tribes. When
first visited by white men, and for many years afterwards, the Falls of
St. Anthony (by them called the <i>Ha Ha</i>) was the center of their
country. They cultivated corn and tobacco, and hunted the elk, the
beaver and the bison. They were open-hearted, truthful and brave. In
their wars with other tribes they seldom slew women or children, and
rarely sacrificed the lives of their prisoners.</p>

<p>For many years their chiefs and head men successfully resisted the
attempts to introduce spirituous liquors among them. More than a century
ago an English trader was killed at Mendota, near the present city of
St. Paul, because he persisted, after repeated warnings by the chiefs,
in dealing out <i>mini wakan</i> (Devil-water) to the Dakota braves.</p>

<p>With open arms and generous hospitality they welcomed the first white
men to their land, and were ever faithful in their friendship, till
years of wrong and robbery, and want and insult, drove them to
desperation and to war. They were barbarians, and their warfare was
barbarous, but not more barbarous than the warfare of our Saxon, Celtic
and Norman ancestors. They were ignorant and superstitious. Their
condition closely resembled the condition of our British forefathers at
the beginning of the Christian era. Macaulay says of Britain: &quot;Her
inhabitants, when first they became known to the Tyrian mariners, were
little superior to the natives of the Sandwich Islands.&quot; And again:
&quot;While the German princes who reigned at Paris, Toledo, Aries and
Ravenna listened with reverence to the instructions of bishops, adored
the relics of martyrs, and took part eagerly in disputes touching the
Nicene theology, the rulers of Wessex and Mercia were still performing
savage rites in the temples of Thor and Woden.&quot;</p>

<p>The days of the Dakotas are done. The degenerate remnants of that once
powerful and warlike people still linger around the forts and agencies
of the Northwest, or chase the caribou and the elk on the banks of the
Saskatchewan, but the Dakotas of old are no more. The brilliant defeat
of Custer, by Sitting Bull and his braves, was their last grand rally
against the resistless march of the sons of the Saxons. The plow-shares
of a superior race are fast leveling the sacred mounds of their dead.
But yesterday, the shores of our lakes and our rivers were dotted with
their <i>teepees,</i> their light canoes glided over our waters, and their
hunters chased the deer and the buffalo on the sites of our cities.
To-day, they are not. Let us do justice to their memory, for there was
much that was noble in their natures.</p>

<p>In the Dakota Legends, I have endeavored to faithfully present many of
the customs and superstitions, and some of the traditions, of that
people. I have taken very little 'poetic license' with their traditions;
none, whatever, with their customs and superstitions. In my studies for
these Legends I was greatly aided by the Rev. S.R. Riggs, author of the
<i>&quot;Grammar and Dictionary of the Dakota Language&quot; &quot;Tah-Koo Wah-Kan,&quot;</i>
&amp;c., and for many years a missionary among the Dakotas. He patiently
answered my numerous inquiries and gave me valuable information. I am
also indebted to the late Gen. H.H. Sibley, one of the earliest
American traders among them, and to Rev. S.W. Pond, of Shakopee, one of
the first Protestant missionaries to these people, and himself the
author of poetical versions of some of their principal legends; to Mrs.
Eastman's <i>&quot;Dacotah,&quot;</i> and last, but not least, to the Rev. E.D. Neill,
whose admirable <i>&quot;History of Minnesota&quot;</i> so fully and faithfully
presents almost all that is known of the history, traditions, customs,
manners and superstitions of the Dakotas.</p>

<p>In <i>Winona</i> I have &quot;tried my hand&quot; on a new hexameter verse. With what
success, I leave to those who are better able to judge than I. If I have
failed, I have but added another failure to the numerous attempts to
naturalize hexameter verse in the English language.</p>

<p>It will be observed that I have slightly changed the length and the
rhythm of the old hexameter line; but it is still hexameter, and, I
think, improved.</p>

<p>I have not written for profit nor published for fame. Fame is a coy
goddess that rarely bestows her favors on him who seeks her&mdash;a phantom
that many pursue and but few overtake.</p>

<p>She delights to hover for a time, like a ghost, over the graves of dead
men who know not and care not: to the living she is a veritable <i>Ignis
Fatuus</i>. But every man owes something to his fellowmen, and I owe much.</p>

<p>If my friends find half the pleasure in reading these poems that I have
found in writing them, I shall have paid my debt and achieved success.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Onward rolls the Royal River, proudly sweeping to the sea,<br /></span>
<span>Dark and deep and grand, forever wrapt in myth and mystery.<br /></span>
<span>Lo he laughs along the highlands, leaping o'er the granite walls;<br /></span>
<span>Lo he sleeps among the islands, where the loon her lover calls.<br /></span>
<span>Still like some huge monster winding downward through the prairied plains,<br /></span>
<span>Seeking rest but never finding, till the tropic gulf he gains.<br /></span>
<span>In his mighty arms he claspeth now an empire broad and grand;<br /></span>
<span>In his left hand lo he graspeth leagues of fen and forest land;<br /></span>
<span>In his right the mighty mountains, hoary with eternal snow,<br /></span>
<span>Where a thousand foaming fountains singing seek the plains below.<br /></span>
<span>Fields of corn and feet of cities lo the mighty river laves,<br /></span>
<span>Where the Saxon sings his ditties o'er the swarthy warriors' graves.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Aye, before the birth of Moses&mdash;ere the Pyramids were piled&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>All his banks were red with roses from the sea to nor'lands wild,<br /></span>
<span>And from forest, fen and meadows, in the deserts of the north,<br /></span>
<span>Elk and bison stalked like shadows, and the tawny tribes came forth;<br /></span>
<span>Deeds of death and deeds of daring on his leafy banks were done,<br /></span>
<span>Women loved and men went warring, ere the siege of Troy begun.<br /></span>
<span>Where his foaming waters thundered, roaring o'er the rocky walls,<br /></span>
<span>Dusky hunters sat and wondered, listening to the spirits' calls.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;<i>Ha-ha!</i>&quot;<a name='FNanchor_76'></a><a href='#Footnote_76'><sup>[76]</sup></a> cried the warrior greeting from afar the cataract's roar;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;<i>Ha-ha!</i>&quot; rolled the answer beating down the rock-ribbed leagues of shore.<br /></span>
<span>Now, alas, the bow and quiver and the dusky braves have fled,<br /></span>
<span>And the sullen, shackled river drives the droning mills instead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Where the war-whoop rose, and after women wailed their warriors slain,<br /></span>
<span>List the Saxon's silvery laughter, and his humming hives of gain.<br /></span>
<span>Swiftly sped the tawny runner o'er the pathless prairies then,<br /></span>
<span>Now the iron-reindeer sooner carries weal or woe to men.<br /></span>
<span>On thy bosom, Royal River, silent sped the birch canoe<br /></span>
<span>Bearing brave with bow and quiver on his way to war or woo;<br /></span>
<span>Now with flaunting flags and streamers&mdash;mighty monsters of the deep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Lo the puffing, panting steamers through thy foaming waters sweep;<br /></span>
<span>And behold the grain-fields golden, where the bison grazed of eld;<br /></span>
<span>See the fanes of forests olden by the ruthless Saxon felled.<br /></span>
<span>Plum&egrave;d pines that spread their shadows ere Columbus spread his sails,<br /></span>
<span>Firs that fringed the mossy meadows ere the Mayflower braved the gales,<br /></span>
<span>Iron oaks that nourished bruin while the Vikings roamed the main,<br /></span>
<span>Crashing fall in broken ruin for the greedy marts of gain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Still forever and forever rolls the restless river on,<br /></span>
<span>Slumbering oft but ceasing never while the circling centuries run.<br /></span>
<span>In his palm the lakelet lingers, in his hair the brooklets hide,<br /></span>
<span>Grasped within his thousand fingers lies a continent fair and wide&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Yea, a mighty empire swarming with its millions like the bees,<br /></span>
<span>Delving, drudging, striving, storming, all their lives, for golden ease.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Still, methinks, the dusky shadows of the days that are no more,<br /></span>
<span>Stalk around the lakes and meadows, haunting oft the wonted shore:<br /></span>
<span>Hunters from the land of spirits seek the bison and the deer<br /></span>
<span>Where the Saxon now inherits golden field and silver mere;<br /></span>
<span>And beside the mound where buried lies the dark-eyed maid he loves,<br /></span>
<span>Some tall warrior, wan and wearied, in the misty moonlight moves.<br /></span>
<span>See&mdash;he stands erect and lingers&mdash;stoic still, but loth to go&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Clutching in his tawny fingers feathered shaft and polished bow.<br /></span>
<span>Never wail or moan he utters and no tear is on his face,<br /></span>
<span>But a warrior's curse he mutters on the crafty Saxon race.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>O thou dark, mysterious River, speak and tell thy tales to me;<br /></span>
<span>Seal not up thy lips forever&mdash;veiled in mist and mystery.<br /></span>
<span>I will sit and lowly listen at the phantom-haunted falls<br /></span>
<span>Where thy waters foam and glisten o'er the rugged, rocky walls,<br /></span>
<span>Till some spirit of the olden, mystic, weird, romantic days<br /></span>
<span>Shall emerge and pour her golden tales and legends through my lays.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Then again the elk and bison on thy grassy banks shall feed,<br /></span>
<span>And along the low horizon shall the plumed hunter speed;<br /></span>
<span>Then again on lake and river shall the silent birch canoe<br /></span>
<span>Bear the brave with bow and quiver on his way to war or woo:<br /></span>
<span>Then the beaver on the meadow shall rebuild his broken wall,<br /></span>
<span>And the wolf shall chase his shadow and his mate the panther call.<br /></span>
<span>From the prairies and the regions where the pine-plumed forest grows<br /></span>
<span>Shall arise the tawny legions with their lances and their bows;<br /></span>
<span>And again the cries of battle shall resound along the plain,<br /></span>
<span>Bows shall twang and quivers rattle, women wail their warriors slain;<br /></span>
<span>And by lodge-fire lowly burning shall the mother from afar<br /></span>
<span>List her warrior's steps returning from the daring deeds of war.<br /></span>

<span><i>&quot;Ta-t&aacute;nka! Ta-t&aacute;nka!&quot;</i><a name='FNanchor_33'></a><a href='#Footnote_33'><sup>[33]</sup></a> the hunters cried,<br /></span>
<span>With a joyous shout at the break of dawn<br /></span>
<span>And darkly lined on the white hill-side,<br /></span>
<span>A herd of bison went marching on<br /></span>
<span>Through the drifted snow like a caravan.<br /></span>
<span>Swift to their ponies the hunters sped,<br /></span>
<span>And dashed away on the hurried chase.<br /></span>
<span>The wild steeds scented the game ahead,<br /></span>
<span>And sprang like hounds to the eager race.<br /></span>
<span>But the brawny bulls in the swarthy van<br /></span>
<span>Turned their polished horns on the charging foes<br /></span>
<span>And reckless rider and fleet footman<br /></span>
<span>Were held at bay in the drifted snows,<br /></span>
<span>While the bellowing herd o'er the hilltops ran,<br /></span>
<span>Like the frightened beasts of a caravan<br /></span>
<span>On Sahara's sands when the simoon blows.<br /></span>
<span>Sharp were the twangs of the hunters' bows,<br /></span>
<span>And swift and humming the arrows sped,<br /></span>
<span>Till ten huge bulls on the bloody snows<br /></span>
<span>Lay pierced with arrows and dumb and dead.<br /></span>
<span>But the chief with the flankers had gained the rear,<br /></span>
<span>And flew on the trail of the flying herd.<br /></span>
<span>The shouts of the riders rang loud and clear,<br /></span>
<span>As their foaming steeds to the chase they spurred.<br /></span>
<span>And now like the roar of an avalanche<br /></span>
<span>Rolls the bellowing wrath of the maddened bulls<br /></span>
<span>They charge on the riders and runners stanch,<br /></span>
<span>And a dying steed in the snow drift rolls,<br /></span>
<span>While the rider, flung to the frozen ground,<br /></span>
<span>Escapes the horns by a panther's bound.<br /></span>
<span>But the raging monsters are held at bay,<br /></span>
<span>While the flankers dash on the swarthy rout:<br /></span>
<span>With lance and arrow they slay and slay;<br /></span>
<span>And the welkin rings to the gladsome shout&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>To the loud <i>In&aacute;'s</i> and the wild <i>Ih&oacute;'s</i>, <a name='FNanchor_34'></a><a href='#Footnote_34'><sup>[34]</sup></a><br /></span>

<span>All snug in the <i>teepee</i> Wiw&acirc;st&egrave; lay,<br /></span>
<span>All wrapped in her robe, at the dawn of day,<br /></span>
<span>All snug and warm from the wind and snow,<br /></span>
<span>While the hunters followed the buffalo.<br /></span>
<span>Her dreams and her slumber their wild shouts broke;<br /></span>
<span>The chase was afoot when the maid awoke;<br /></span>
<span>She heard the twangs of the hunters' bows,<br /></span>
<span>And the bellowing bulls and the loud <i>Ih&oacute;</i>'s,<br /></span>
<span>And she murmured&mdash;&quot;My hunter is far away<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span>She heard, and the murmur of voices low:&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Then the warriors' greeting&mdash;<i>Ih&oacute;! Ih&oacute;!</i><br /></span>
<span>And behold, in the blaze of the risen day,<br /></span>
<span>With the hunters that followed the buffalo&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Came her tall, young hunter&mdash;her brave Chask&egrave;.<br /></span>
<span>Far south has he followed the bison-trail<br /></span>
<span>With his band of warriors so brave and true.<br /></span>

<span>Mild was his face as the morning skies,<br /></span>
<span>And friendship shone in his laughing eyes;<br /></span>

<span>On the trail of the elk or the buffalo,<br /></span>
<span>And his heart was stouter than lance or bow,<br /></span>
<span>When he heard the whoop of his enemies.<br /></span>
<span>Five feathers he wore of the great Wanmde&egrave;<br /></span>
<span>And each for the scalp of a warrior slain,<br /></span>

<span>With their murder-cries rode the bloody <i>Cree</i>.<a name='FNanchor_35'></a><a href='#Footnote_35'><sup>[35]</sup></a><br /></span>

<span>In peace, like the breeze from the summer seas&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>In war, like the roar of the mountain storm.<br /></span>
<span>His fame in the voice of the winds went forth<br /></span>

<span>And far as the shores of the <i>Great Med&egrave;</i> <a name='FNanchor_36'></a><a href='#Footnote_36'><sup>[36]</sup></a><br /></span>

<span>The clouded face of the warrior saw.<br /></span>
<span>Softly she spoke to the sullen brave:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Mah-p&iacute;-ya D&uacute;ta&mdash;his face is sad;<br /></span>
<span>And why is the warrior so glum and grave?<br /></span>
<span>For the fair Wiw&acirc;st&egrave; is gay and glad;<br /></span>

<span>There are fairer maidens than she, and proud<br /></span>
<span>Were their hearts to be loved by the brave Red Cloud.<br /></span>
<span>And trust not the chief with the smiling eyes;<br /></span>
<span>His tongue is swift, but his words are lies;<br /></span>
<span>And the proud Mah-p&iacute;-ya will surely find<br /></span>
<span>That Wak&acirc;wa's promise is hollow wind.<br /></span>
<span>Last night I stood by his lodge, and lo<br /></span>
<span>I heard the voice of the Little Crow;<br /></span>

<span>With his battle-spear and his bow and quiver,<br /></span>
<span>And eagle-plumes in his ebon hair,<br /></span>
<span>The chief Wak&acirc;wa himself is there;<br /></span>
<span>And round the feast, in the Sacred Ring,<a name='FNanchor_48'></a><a href='#Footnote_48'><sup>[48]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span>Sit his weaponed warriors witnessing.<br /></span>
<span>Not a morsel of food have the Virgins tasted<br /></span>

<span>The blushing pink and the meek blue-bell,<br /></span>
<span>The purple plumes of the prairie's pride,<a name='FNanchor_49'></a><a href='#Footnote_49'><sup>[49]</sup></a><br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span>But why did the lover so long delay?<br /></span>
<span>And whitherward rideth the chief to-day?<br /></span>
<span>As he followed the trail of the buffalo,<br /></span>
<span>From the <i>tees</i> of <i>Kap&oacute;za</i> a maiden, lo,<br /></span>
<span>Came running in haste o'er the drifted snow.<br /></span>
<span>She spoke to the chief of the tall <i>H&oacute;h&egrave;</i>:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Wiw&acirc;st&egrave; requests that the brave Chask&egrave;<br /></span>
<span>Will abide with his band and his coming delay<br /></span>
<span>Till the moon when the strawberries are ripe and red,<br /></span>
<span>And then will the chief and Wiw&acirc;st&egrave; wed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>When the Feast of the Virgins is past,&quot; she said.<br /></span>
<span>Wiw&acirc;st&egrave;'s wish was her lover's law;<br /></span>
<span>And so his coming the chief delayed<br /></span>
<span>Till the mid May blossoms should bloom and fade&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>But the lying runner was H&acirc;rpstin&agrave;.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And now with the gifts for the bridal day<br /></span>
<span>And his chosen warriors he took his way,<br /></span>
<span>And followed his heart to his moon-faced maid.<br /></span>
<span>And thus was the lover so long delayed;<br /></span>
<span>And so as he rode with his warriors gay,<br /></span>
<span>On that bright and beautiful summer day,<br /></span>
<span>His bride he met on the trail mid-way.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>God arms the innocent. He is there&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>In the desert vast, in the wilderness,<br /></span>
<span>On the bellowing sea, in the lion's lair,<br /></span>
<span>In the mist of battle, and everywhere.<br /></span>
<span>In his hand he holds with a father's care<br /></span>
<span>The tender hearts of the motherless;<br /></span>
<span>The maid and the mother in sore distress<br /></span>
<span>He shields with his love and his tenderness;<br /></span>
<span>He comforts the widowed&mdash;the comfortless&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And sweetens her chalice of bitterness;<br /></span>
<span>He clothes the naked&mdash;the numberless&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>His charity covers their nakedness&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And he feeds the famished and fatherless<br /></span>
<span>With the hand that feedeth the birds of air.<br /></span>
<span>Let the myriad tongues of the earth confess<br /></span>
<span>His infinite love and his holiness;<br /></span>
<span>For his pity pities the pitiless,<br /></span>
<span>His mercy flows to the merciless;<br /></span>
<span>And the countless worlds in the realms above,<br /></span>
<span>Revolve in the light of his boundless love.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And what of the lovers? you ask, I trow.<br /></span>
<span>She told him all ere the sun was low&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Why she fled from the Feast to a safe retreat.<br /></span>
<span>She laid her heart at her lover's feet,<br /></span>
<span>And her words were tears and her lips were slow.<br /></span>
<span>As she sadly related the bitter tale<br /></span>
<span>His face was aflame and anon grew pale,<br /></span>
<span>And his dark eyes flashed with a brave desire,<br /></span>
<span>Like the midnight gleam of the sacred fire. <a name='FNanchor_65'></a><a href='#Footnote_65'><sup>[65]</sup></a><br /></span>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Fair morning sat upon the mountain-top,<br /></span>
<span>Night skulking crept into the mountain-chasm.<br /></span>
<span>The silent ships slept in the silent bay;<br /></span>
<span>One broad blue bent of ether domed the heavens,<br /></span>
<span>One broad blue distance lay the shadowy land,<br /></span>
<span>One broad blue vast of silence slept the sea.<br /></span>
<span>Now from the dewy groves the joyful birds<br /></span>
<span>In carol-concert sang their matin songs<br /></span>
<span>Softly and sweetly&mdash;full of prayer and praise.<br /></span>
<span>Then silver-chiming, solemn-voiced bells<br /></span>
<span>Rung out their music on the morning air,<br /></span>
<span>And Lisbon gathered to the festival<br /></span>
<span>In chapel and cathedral. Choral hymns<br /></span>
<span>And psalms of sea-toned organs mingling rose<br /></span>
<span>With sweetest incense floating up to heaven,<br /></span>
<span>Bearing the praises of the multitudes;<br /></span>
<span>And all was holy peace and holy happiness.<br /></span>
<span>A rumbling of deep thunders in the deep;<br /></span>
<span>The vast sea shuddered and the mountains groaned;<br /></span>
<span>Up-heaved the solid earth&mdash;the nether rocks<br /></span>
<span>Burst&mdash;and the sea&mdash;the earth&mdash;the echoing heavens<br /></span>
<span>Thundered infernal ruin. On their knees<br /></span>
<span>The trembling multitudes received the shock,<br /></span>
<span>And dumb with sudden terror bowed their heads<br /></span>
<span>To toppling spire and plunging wall and dome.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>So shook the mighty North the sudden roar<br /></span>
<span>Of Treason thundering on the April air&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>An earthquake shock that jarred the granite hills<br /></span>
<span>And westward rolled against th' eternal walls<br /></span>
<span>Rock-built Titanic&mdash;for a moment shook:<br /></span>
<span>Uprose a giant and with iron hands<br /></span>
<span>Grasped his huge hammer, claspt his belt of steel,<br /></span>
<span>And o'er the Midgard-monster mighty Thor<br /></span>
<span>Loomed for the combat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">Peace&mdash;O blessed Peace!<br /></span>
<span>The war-worn veterans hailed thee with a shout<br /></span>
<span>Of Alleluias;&mdash;homeward wound the trains,<br /></span>
<span>And homeward marched the bayonet-bristling columns<br /></span>
<span>To &quot;<i>Hail Columbia</i>&quot; from a thousand horns&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Marched to the jubilee of chiming bells,<br /></span>
<span>Marched to the joyful peals of cannon, marched<br /></span>
<span>With blazing banners and victorious songs<br /></span>
<span>Into the outstretched arms of love and home.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>But there be columns&mdash;columns of the dead<br /></span>
<span>That slumber on an hundred battle-fields&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>No bugle-blast shall waken till the trump<br /></span>
<span>Of the Archangel. O the loved and lost!<br /></span>
<span>For them no jubilee of chiming bells;<br /></span>
<span>For them no cannon-peal of victory;<br /></span>
<span>For them no outstretched arms of love and home.<br /></span>
<span>God's peace be with them. Heroes who went down,<br /></span>
<span>Wearing their stars, live in the nation's songs<br /></span>
<span>And stories&mdash;there be greater heroes still,<br /></span>
<span>That molder in unnumbered nameless graves<br /></span>
<span>Erst bleached unburied on the fields of fame<br /></span>
<span>Won by their valor. Who will sing of these&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Sing of the patriot-deeds on field and flood&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Of these&mdash;the truer heroes&mdash;all unsung?<br /></span>
<span>Where sleeps the modest bard in Quaker gray<br /></span>
<span>Who blew the pibroch ere the battle lowered,<br /></span>
<span>Then pitched his tent upon the balmy beach?<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Snow-bound,&quot; I ween, among his native hills.<br /></span>
<span>And where the master hand that swept the lyre<br /></span>
<span>Till wrinkled critics cried &quot;Excelsior&quot;?<br /></span>
<span>Gathering the &quot;Aftermath&quot; in frosted fields.<br /></span>
<span>Then, timid Muse, no longer shake thy wings<br /></span>
<span>For airy realms and fold again in fear;<br /></span>
<span>A broken flight is better than no flight;<br /></span>
<span>Be thine the task, as best you may, to sing<br /></span>
<span>The deeds of one who sleeps at Gettysburg<br /></span>
<span>Among the thousands in a common grave.<br /></span>
<span>The story of his life I bid you tell<br /></span>
<span>As it was told one windy winter night<br /></span>
<span>To veterans gathered around the festal board,<br /></span>
<span>Fighting old battles over where the field<br /></span>
<span>Ran red with wine, and all the battle-blare<br /></span>
<span>Was merry laughter and the merry songs&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Told when the songs were sung by him who heard<br /></span>
<span>The pith of it from the dying soldier's lips&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>His Captain&mdash;tell it as the Captain told.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>THE CAPTAIN'S STORY</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Well, comrades, let us fight one battle more;<br /></span>
<span>Let the cock crow&mdash;we'll guard the camp till morn.<br /></span>
<span>And&mdash;since the singers and the merry ones<br /></span>
<span>Are <i>hors de combat</i>&mdash;fill the cups again;<br /></span>
<span>Nod if you must, but listen to a tale<br /></span>
<span>Romantic&mdash;but the warp thereof is truth.<br /></span>
<span>When the old Flag on Sumter's sea-girt walls<br /></span>
<span>From its proud perch a fluttering ruin fell,<br /></span>
<span>I swore an oath as big as Bunker Hill;<br /></span>
<span>For I was younger then, nor battle-scarred,<br /></span>
<span>And full of patriot-faith and patriot-fire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I raised a company of riflemen,<br /></span>
<span>Marched to the front, and proud of my command,<br /></span>
<span>Nor seeking higher, led them till the day<br /></span>
<span>Of triumph and the nation's jubilee.<br /></span>
<span>Among the first that answered to my call<br /></span>
<span>The hero came whose story you shall hear.<br /></span>
<span>'Tis better I describe him: He was young&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Near two and twenty&mdash;neither short nor tall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A slender student, and his tapering hands<br /></span>
<span>Had better graced a maiden than a man:<br /></span>
<span>Sad, thoughtful face&mdash;a wealth of raven hair<br /></span>
<span>Brushed back in waves from forehead prominent;<br /></span>
<span>A classic nose&mdash;half Roman and half Greek;<br /></span>
<span>Dark, lustrous eyes beneath dark, jutting brows,<br /></span>
<span>Wearing a shade of sorrow, yet so keen,<br /></span>
<span>And in the storm of battle flashing fire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;'Well, boy,' I said, 'I doubt if you will do;<br /></span>
<span>I need stout men for picket-line and march&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Men that have bone and muscle&mdash;men inured<br /></span>
<span>To toil and hardships&mdash;men, in short, my boy,<br /></span>
<span>To march and fight and march and fight again.'<br /></span>
<span>A queer expression lit his earnest face&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Half frown&mdash;half smile.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">&quot;'Well <i>try</i> me.' That was all<br /></span>
<span>He answered, and I put him on the roll&mdash;<br /></span>
<span><i>Paul Douglas, private</i>&mdash;and he donned the blue.<br /></span>
<span>Paul proved himself the best in my command;<br /></span>
<span>I found him first at <i>reveille</i>, and first<br /></span>
<span>In all the varied duties of the day.<br /></span>
<span>His rough-hewn comrades, bred to boisterous ways,<br /></span>
<span>Jeered at the slender youth with maiden hands,<br /></span>
<span>Nicknamed him 'Nel,' and for a month or more<br /></span>
<span>Kept up a fusillade of jokes and jeers.<br /></span>
<span>Their jokes and jeers he heard but heeded not,<br /></span>
<span>Or heeding did a kindly act for him<br /></span>
<span>That jeered him loudest; so the hardy men<br /></span>
<span>Came to look up to Paul as one above<br /></span>
<span>The level of their rough and roistering ways.<br /></span>
<span>He never joined the jolly soldier-sports,<br /></span>
<span>But ever was the first at bugle-call,<br /></span>
<span>Mastered the drill and often drilled the men.<br /></span>
<span>Fatigued with duty, weary with the march<br /></span>
<span>Under the blaze of the midsummer sun,<br /></span>
<span>He murmured not&mdash;alike in sun or rain<br /></span>
<span>His utmost duty eager to perform,<br /></span>
<span>And ever ready&mdash;always just the same<br /></span>
<span>Patient and earnest, sad and silent Paul.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The day of battle came&mdash;that Sabbath day,<br /></span>
<span>Midsummer.<a name='FNanchor_A'></a><a href='#Footnote_A'><sup>[A]</sup></a> Hot and blistering as the flames<br /></span>
<span>Of prairie-fires wind-driven, the burning sun<br /></span>
<span>Blazed down upon us and the blinding dust<br /></span>
<span>Wheeled in dense clouds and covered all our ranks,<br /></span>
<span>As we marched on to battle. Then the roar<br /></span>
<span>Of batteries broke upon us. Glad indeed<br /></span>
<span>That music to my soldiers, and they cheered<br /></span>
<span>And cheered again and boasted&mdash;all but Paul&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And shouted <i>'On to Richmond!'</i>&mdash;He alone<br /></span>
<span>Was silent&mdash;but his eyes were full of fire.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Then came the order&mdash;<i>'Forward, double quick!'</i><br /></span>
<span>And we rushed into battle&mdash;formed our line<br /></span>
<span>Facing the foe&mdash;the ambushed, deadly foe,<br /></span>
<span>Hid in the thicket, with the Union flag&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A cheat&mdash;hung out before it&mdash;luring us<br /></span>
<span>Into a blazing hell. The battle broke<br /></span>
<span>With wildest fury on us&mdash;crashed and roared<br /></span>
<span>The rolling thunder of continuous fire.<br /></span>
<span>We broke and rallied&mdash;charged and broke again,<br /></span>
<span>And rallied still&mdash;broke counter-charge and charged<br /></span>
<span>Loud-yelling, furious, on the hidden foe;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Met thrice our numbers and came flying back<br /></span>
<span>Disordered and disheartened. Yet again<br /></span>
<span>I strove to rally my discouraged men,<br /></span>
<span>But hell was fairly howling;&mdash;only Paul&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Eager, but bleeding from a bullet-wound<br /></span>
<span>In the left arm&mdash;came bounding to my side.<br /></span>
<span>But at that moment I was struck and fell&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Fell prostrate; and a swooning sense of death<br /></span>
<span>Came on me, and I saw and heard no more<br /></span>
<span>Of battle on that Sabbath.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&quot;I awoke,<br /></span>
<span>Confined and jolted in an ambulance<br /></span>
<span>Piled with the wounded&mdash;driven recklessly<br /></span>
<span>By one who chiefly cared to save himself.<br /></span>
<span>Dizzy and faint I raised my head: my wound<br /></span>
<span>Was not as dangerous as it might have been&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A scalp-wound on the temple; there, you see&mdash;&quot;<br /></span>
<span>He put his finger on the ugly scar&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Half an inch deeper and some soldier friend,<br /></span>
<span>Among the veterans gathered here to-night,<br /></span>
<span>Perchance had told a briefer tale than mine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;In front and rear I saw the reckless rout&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A broken army flying panic-struck&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Our proud brigades of undulating steel<br /></span>
<span>That marched at sunrise under blazoned flags,<br /></span>
<span>Singing the victory ere the cannon roared,<br /></span>
<span>And eager for the honors of the day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Like bison Indian-chased on windy plains,<br /></span>
<span>Now broken and commingled fled the field.<br /></span>
<span>Words of command were only wasted breath;<br /></span>
<span>Colonels and brigadiers, on foot and soiled,<br /></span>
<span>Were pushed and jostled by the hurrying hordes.<br /></span>
<span>Anon the cry of <i>'Cavalry!'</i> arose,<br /></span>
<span>And army-teams came dashing down the road<br /></span>
<span>And plunged into the panic. All the way<br /></span>
<span>Was strewn with broken wagons, battery-guns,<br /></span>
<span>Tents, muskets, knapsacks and exhausted men.<br /></span>
<span>My men were mingled with the lawless crowd,<br /></span>
<span>And in the swarm behind us, there was Paul&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Silent and soldier-like, with knapsack on<br /></span>
<span>And rifle on his shoulder, guarding me<br /></span>
<span>And marching on behind the ambulance.<br /></span>
<span>So all that dark and dreadful night we marched,<br /></span>
<span>Each man a captain&mdash;captain of himself&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Nor cared for orders on that wild retreat<br /></span>
<span>To safety from disaster. All that night,<br /></span>
<span>Silent and soldier-like my wounded Paul<br /></span>
<span>Marched close behind and kept his faithful watch.<br /></span>
<span>For ever and anon the jaded men,<br /></span>
<span>Clamorous and threat'ning, sought to clamber in;<br /></span>
<span>Whom Paul drove off at point of bayonet,<br /></span>
<span>Wielding his musket with his good right arm.<br /></span>
<span>But when the night was waning to the morn<br /></span>
<span>I saw that he was weary and I made<br /></span>
<span>A place for Paul and begged him to get in.<br /></span>
<span>'No, Captain; no,' he answered,&mdash;'I will walk&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>I'm making bone and muscle&mdash;learning how<br /></span>
<span>To march and fight and march and fight again.'<br /></span>
<span>That silenced me, and we went rumbling on.<br /></span>
<span>Till morning found us safe at Arlington.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;A month off duty and a faithful nurse<br /></span>
<span>Worked wonders and my head was whole again&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Nay&mdash;to be candid&mdash;cracked a little yet.<br /></span>
<span>My nurse was Paul. Albeit his left arm,<br /></span>
<span>Flesh-wounded, pained him sorely for a time,<br /></span>
<span>With filial care he dressed my battered head,<br /></span>
<span>And wrote for me to anxious friends at home&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>But never wrote a letter for himself.<br /></span>
<span>Thinking of this one day, I spoke of it:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A cloud came o'er his face.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&quot;'My friends,' he said,<br /></span>
<span>'Are here among my comrades in the camp.'<br /></span>
<span>That made a mystery and I questioned him:<br /></span>
<span>He gave no answer&mdash;or evasive ones&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Seeming to shrink from question, and to wrap<br /></span>
<span>Himself within himself and live within.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Again we joined our regiment and marched;<br /></span>
<span>Over the hills and dales of Maryland<br /></span>
<span>Along the famous river wound our way.<br /></span>
<span>On picket-duty at the frequent fords<br /></span>
<span>For weary, laggard months were we employed<br /></span>
<span>Guarding the broad Potomac, while our foes,<br /></span>
<span>Stealthily watching for their human game,<br /></span>
<span>Lurked like Apaches on the wooded shores.<br /></span>
<span>Bands of enemy's cavalry by night<br /></span>
<span>Along the line of river prowled, and sought<br /></span>
<span>To dash across and raid in Maryland.<br /></span>
<span>Three regiments guarded miles of river-bank,<br /></span>
<span>And drilled alternately, and one was ours.<br /></span>
<span>Off picket duty, alike in fair or foul,<br /></span>
<span>With knapsacks on and bearing forty rounds,<br /></span>
<span>From morn till night we drilled&mdash;battalion-drill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Often at double-quick for weary hours&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Bearing our burdens in the blazing sun,<br /></span>
<span>Till strong men staggered from the ranks and fell.<br /></span>
<span>Aye, many a hardy man in those hard days<br /></span>
<span>Was drilled and disciplined into his grave. Arose<br /></span>
<span>Murmurs of discontent, and loud complaints<br /></span>
<span>Fell on dull ears till patience was worn out<br /></span>
<span>And mutiny was hinted. As for Paul<br /></span>
<span>I never heard a murmur from his lips;<br /></span>
<span>Nor did he ask a reason for the things<br /></span>
<span>Unreasonable and hard required of him,<br /></span>
<span>But straightway did his duty just as if<br /></span>
<span>The nation's fate hung on it. I pitied Paul;<br /></span>
<span>Slender of form and delicate, he bore<br /></span>
<span>The toils and duties of the hardiest.<br /></span>
<span>Ill from exposure, or fatigued and worn,<br /></span>
<span>On picket hungered, shivering in the rain,<br /></span>
<span>Or sweltering in full dress, with knapsack on,<br /></span>
<span>Beneath the blaze of the mid-summer sun,<br /></span>
<span>He held his spirit&mdash;always still the same<br /></span>
<span>Patient and earnest, sad and silent Paul.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;We posted pickets two by two. At night,<br /></span>
<span>By turns each comrade slept and took the watch.<br /></span>
<span>Once in September, in a drenching storm,<br /></span>
<span>Three days and nights with neither tent nor fire<br /></span>
<span>Paul and a comrade held a picket-post.<br /></span>
<span>The equinox raged madly. Chilling winds<br /></span>
<span>In angry gusts roared from the northern hills,<br /></span>
<span>Dashing the dismal rain-clouds into showers<br /></span>
<span>That fell in torrents over all the land.<br /></span>
<span>In camp the soldiers crouched in dripping tents,<br /></span>
<span>Or shivered by the camp-fires. I was ill<br /></span>
<span>And gladly sought the shelter of a hut.<br /></span>
<span>Orders were strict and often hard to bear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Nor tents nor fire upon the picket-posts&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Cold rations and a canopy of storms.<br /></span>
<span>I pitied Paul and would have called him in,<br /></span>
<span>But that I had no man to take his place;<br /></span>
<span>Nor did I know he took upon himself<br /></span>
<span>A double task. His comrade on the post<br /></span>
<span>Was ill, and so he made a shelter for him<br /></span>
<span>With his own blankets and a bed within;<br /></span>
<span>And took the watch of both upon himself.<br /></span>
<span>And on the third night near the dawn of day,<br /></span>
<span>In rubber cloak stole in upon the post<br /></span>
<span>A pompous major, on the nightly round,<br /></span>
<span>Unchallenged. All fatigued and drenched with rain,<br /></span>
<span>Still on his post with rifle in his hand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Against a sheltering elm Paul stood and slept.<br /></span>
<span>Muttering of death the brutal major stormed,<br /></span>
<span>Then pitiless pricked the comrade with his sword,<br /></span>
<span>And from his shelter drove him to the watch,<br /></span>
<span>Burning with fever. There Paul interposed<br /></span>
<span>And said:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">&quot;'I ask no mercy at your hands;<br /></span>
<span>I shall not whimper, but my comrade here<br /></span>
<span>Is ill of fever; I have stood his watch:<br /></span>
<span>Sir, if a human heart beats in your breast,<br /></span>
<span>Send him to camp, or he will surely die.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The pompous brute&mdash;vaingloriously great<br /></span>
<span>In straps and buttons&mdash;haughtily silenced Paul,<br /></span>
<span>Hand-bound and sent him guarded to the camp,<br /></span>
<span>And the poor comrade shivering stood the watch<br /></span>
<span>Till dawn of day and I was made aware.<br /></span>
<span>Among the true were some vainglorious fools<br /></span>
<span>Called by the fife and drum from native mire<br /></span>
<span>To lord and strut in shoulder-straps and buttons.<br /></span>
<span>Scrubs, born to brush the boots of gentlemen,<br /></span>
<span>By sudden freak of fortune found themselves<br /></span>
<span>Masters of better men, and lorded it<br /></span>
<span>As only base and brutish natures can&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Braves on parade and cowards under fire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I interceded in my Paul's behalf,<br /></span>
<span>Else he had suffered graver punishment,<br /></span>
<span>But as himself for mercy would not beg&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'A stubborn boy,' our bluff old colonel said&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>To extra duty for a month he went<br /></span>
<span>Unmurmuring, storm or shine. When the cold rain<br /></span>
<span>Poured down most pitiless Paul, drenched and wan,<br /></span>
<span>Guarded the baggage and the braying mules.<br /></span>
<span>When the hot sun at mid-day blazed and burned,<br /></span>
<span>Like the red flame on Mauna Loa's top,<br /></span>
<span>Withering the grass and parching earth and air,<br /></span>
<span>I often saw him knapsacked and full-dressed,<br /></span>
<span>Drilling the raw recruits at double-quick;<br /></span>
<span>And yet he wore a patient countenance,<br /></span>
<span>And went about his duty earnestly<br /></span>
<span>As if it were a pleasure to obey.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The month wore off and mad disaster came&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Gorging the blood of heroes at Ball's Bluff.<br /></span>
<span>'Twas there the brave, unfaltering Baker fell<br /></span>
<span>Fighting despair between the jaws of death.<br /></span>
<span>Quenched was the flame that fired a thousand hearts;<br /></span>
<span>Hushed was the voice that shook the senate-walls,<br /></span>
<span>And rang defiance like a bugle-blast.<br /></span>
<span>Broad o'er the rugged mountains to the north<br /></span>
<span>Fell the incessant rain till, like a sea,<br /></span>
<span>Him and the deadly ambush of the foe<br /></span>
<span>The swollen river rolled and roared between.<br /></span>
<span>Brave Baker saw the peril, but not his<br /></span>
<span>The soul to shrink or falter, though he saw<br /></span>
<span>His death-warrant in his orders. Forth he led<br /></span>
<span>His proud brigade across the roaring chasm,<br /></span>
<span>Firm and unfaltering into the chasm of death.<br /></span>
<span>From morn till mid-day in a single boat<br /></span>
<span>Unfit, by companies, the fearless band<br /></span>
<span>Passed over the raging river; then advanced<br /></span>
<span>Upon the ambushed foe. We heard the roll<br /></span>
<span>Of volleys in the forest, and uprose,<br /></span>
<span>From out the wood, a cloud of battle-smoke.<br /></span>
<span>Then came the yell of foemen charging down<br /></span>
<span>Rank upon rank and furious. Hand to hand,<br /></span>
<span>The little band of heroes, flanked and pressed,<br /></span>
<span>Fought thrice their numbers; fearless Baker led<br /></span>
<span>In prodigies of valor; front and flank<br /></span>
<span>Volleyed the deadly rifles; in the rear<br /></span>
<span>The rapid, raging river rolled and roared.<br /></span>
<span>Along the Maryland shore a mile below,<br /></span>
<span>Eager to cross and reinforce our friends,<br /></span>
<span>Ten thousand soldiers lay upon their arms;<br /></span>
<span>And we had boats to spare. In all our ranks<br /></span>
<span>There was not one who did not comprehend<br /></span>
<span>The peril and the instant need of aid.<br /></span>
<span>Chafing we waited orders. We could see<br /></span>
<span>That Baker's men were fighting in retreat;<br /></span>
<span>For ever nearer o'er the forest rolled<br /></span>
<span>The smoke of battle. Orders came at last,<br /></span>
<span>And up along the shore our regiment ran,<br /></span>
<span>Eager to aid our comrades, but too late!<br /></span>
<span>Baker had fallen in the battle-front;<br /></span>
<span>He fought like Spartan and like Spartan fell<br /></span>
<span>Defiant, clutching at the throat of fate.<br /></span>
<span>Their leader lost, confusion followed fast;<br /></span>
<span>Wild panic and red slaughter swept the field.<br /></span>
<span>Powerless to saves we saw the farther shore<br /></span>
<span>Covered with wounded and wild fugitives&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Our own defeated and defenseless friends.<br /></span>
<span>Shattered and piled with wounded men the boat<br /></span>
<span>Pushed off to brave the river, while the foe<br /></span>
<span>Pressed on the charge with fury, and refused<br /></span>
<span>Mercy to the vanquished. Officers and men,<br /></span>
<span>Cheating the savage foemen of their spoils,<br /></span>
<span>Their flags and arms into the gurgling depths<br /></span>
<span>Despairing hurled, and following plunged amain.<br /></span>
<span>As numerous as the wild aquatic flocks<br /></span>
<span>That float in autumn on Lake Nepigon,<br /></span>
<span>The heads of swimmers moved upon the flood.<br /></span>
<span>And still upon the shore a Spartan few&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Shoulder to shoulder&mdash;back to back, as one&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Amid the din and clang of clashing steel,<br /></span>
<span>Surrounded held the swarming foes at bay.<br /></span>
<span>As in the pre-historic centuries&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Unnumbered ages ere the Pyramids&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Whereof we read on pre-diluvian bones<br /></span>
<span>And fretted flints in excavated caves,<br /></span>
<span>When savage men abode in rocky dens,<br /></span>
<span>And wrought their weapons from the fiery flint,<br /></span>
<span>And clothed their tawny thighs in lion-skins&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Before the mouth of some well-guarded cave,<br /></span>
<span>Where smoked the savory flesh of mammoth, came<br /></span>
<span>The great cave-bear unbidden to the feast.<br /></span>
<span>Around the monster swarm the brawny men,<br /></span>
<span>Wielding with sinewy arms and savage cries<br /></span>
<span>Their flinty spears and tomahawks of stone.<br /></span>
<span>Erect old bruin growls upon his foes,<br /></span>
<span>And swings with mighty power his ponderous paws&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Woe unto him who feels the crushing blow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Till, bleeding from an hundred wounds and blind,<br /></span>
<span>With sudden plunge he falls at last, and dies<br /></span>
<span>Amid the shouts of his wild enemies.<br /></span>
<span>So fought the Spartan few, till one by one,<br /></span>
<span>They fell surrounded by a wall of foes.<br /></span>
<span>The river boiled beneath the storm of lead;<br /></span>
<span>Weighed down with wounded comrades many sunk,<br /></span>
<span>But more went down with bullets in their heads.<br /></span>
<span>O! it was pitiful. The outstretched hands<br /></span>
<span>Of men that erst had faced the battle-storm<br /></span>
<span>Unshaken, grasping now in wild despair,<br /></span>
<span>Wrung cries of pity from us. Vain our fire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The range too long&mdash;it fell upon our friends;<br /></span>
<span>At which the foemen yelled their mad delight.<br /></span>
<span>A storm of bullets poured upon the boat,<br /></span>
<span>Mangling the mangled on her, till at last,<br /></span>
<span>Shattered and over-laden, suddenly<br /></span>
<span>She made a lurch to leeward and went down.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;A shallow boat lay moored upon the shore;<br /></span>
<span>Our gallant Colonel called for volunteers<br /></span>
<span>In mercy's name to man it and push out.<br /></span>
<span>But all could see the peril. Stout the heart<br /></span>
<span>Would dare to face the raging flood and fire,<br /></span>
<span>And to his call responded not a man&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Save Paul and one who perished at the helm.<br /></span>
<span>They went as if at bugle-call to drill;<br /></span>
<span>Their comrades said, 'They never will return.'<br /></span>
<span>Stoutly and steadily Paul rowed the boat<br /></span>
<span>Athwart the turbid river's sullen tide,<br /></span>
<span>And reached the wounded struggling in the flood.<br /></span>
<span>Bravely they worked away and lifted in<br /></span>
<span>The helpless till the boat would hold no more;<br /></span>
<span>Others they helped to holds upon the rails,<br /></span>
<span>Then pulled away the over-laden craft.<br /></span>
<span>We cheered them from the shore. The maddened foe<br /></span>
<span>With furious volleys answered&mdash;hitting oft<br /></span>
<span>The little craft of mercy&mdash;hands anon<br /></span>
<span>Let go their holds and sunk into the deep.<br /></span>
<span>And in that storm Paul's gallant comrade fell.<br /></span>
<span>Trimming his craft with caution Paul could make<br /></span>
<span>But little headway with a single oar&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Clutched in despair and madly wrenched away<br /></span>
<span>By drowning souls the other. Firm and cool<br /></span>
<span>Paul stood unscathed; then fell a sudden shower<br /></span>
<span>That broke his bended oar-stem at the blade.<br /></span>
<span>Down to the brink we crept and stretched our hands,<br /></span>
<span>And shouted, 'Overboard, Paul! and save yourself.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;He stood a moment as if all were lost,<br /></span>
<span>Then caught the rope, and stretching forth his hand,<br /></span>
<span>Waved to the foe and plunged into the flood.<br /></span>
<span>Slowly he towed the clumsy craft and swam,<br /></span>
<span>Down-drifting with the rapid, rolling stream.<br /></span>
<span>Cheering him on adown the shore we ran;<br /></span>
<span>The current lent its aid and bore him in<br /></span>
<span>Toward us, and beyond the range at last<br /></span>
<span>Of foemen's fire he safely came to land,<br /></span>
<span>Mooring his boat amid a storm of cheers.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Confined in hospital three days he lay<br /></span>
<span>Fatigued and feverous, but tender hands<br /></span>
<span>Nursed and restored him. Our old Colonel came<br /></span>
<span>And thanked him&mdash;patting Paul paternally&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And praised his daring. 'My brave boy,' he said,<br /></span>
<span>'Had I a regiment of such men, by Jove!<br /></span>
<span>I'd hew a path to Richmond and to fame.'<br /></span>
<span>Paul made reply, and in his smile and tone<br /></span>
<span>Mingled a touch of sarcasm:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&quot;'Thank you, sir;<br /></span>
<span>But let me add&mdash;I fear the wary foe<br /></span>
<span>Would nab your regiment napping on the field.<br /></span>
<span>You have forgotten, Colonel&mdash;not so fast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>I am the man that slept upon his post.'<br /></span>
<span>Our bluff old Colonel laughed and turned away;<br /></span>
<span>Ten minutes later came his kind reply&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A basketful of luxuries from his mess.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Paul marched and fought and marched and fought again,<br /></span>
<span>Patient and earnest through the bootless toils<br /></span>
<span>And fiery trials of that dread campaign<br /></span>
<span>Upon the Peninsula. 'Twas fitly called<br /></span>
<span>'Campaign of Battles.' Aye, it sorely pierced<br /></span>
<span>The scarred and bleeding nation, and drew blood<br /></span>
<span>Deep from her vitals till she shook and reeled,<br /></span>
<span>Like some huge giant staggering to his fall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Blinded with blood, yet struggling with his soul,<br /></span>
<span>And stretching forth his ponderous, brawny arms,<br /></span>
<span>Like Samson in the Temple, to o'erwhelm<br /></span>
<span>And crush his mocking enemies in his fall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Ah, Malvern! you remember Malvern Hill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>That night of dreadful butchery! Round the top<br /></span>

<span>Blazed like Vesuvius when he bellows fire<br /></span>
<span>And molten lava into the midnight heavens,<br /></span>
<span>An hundred crashing cannon, and the hill<br /></span>
<span>Shook to the thunder of the mighty guns,<br /></span>
<span>As ocean trembles to the bursting throes<br /></span>
<span>Of submarine volcanoes; and the shells<br /></span>
<span>From the embattled gun-boats&mdash;fiery fiends&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Shrieked on the night and through the ether hissed<br /></span>
<span>Like hell's infernals. Line supporting line,<br /></span>
<span>From base to summit round the blazing hill,<br /></span>
<span>Our infantry was posted. Crowned with fire,<br /></span>
<span>And zoned by many a burning, blazing belt<br /></span>
<span>From head to foot, and belching sulphurous flames,<br /></span>
<span>The embattled hill appeared a raging fiend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The Lucifer of hell let loose to reign<br /></span>
<span>Over a world wrapt in the final fires.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;In solid columns massed our frenzied foes<br /></span>

<span>Beating in vain against the solid cliffs.<br /></span>
<span>Foremost in from our veteran regiment<br /></span>
<span>Breasted the brunt of battle, but we bent<br /></span>
<span>Beneath the onsets as the red-hot bar<br /></span>
<span>Bends to the sledge, until our furious foes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Mown as the withered prairie-grass is mown<br /></span>
<span>By wild October fires&mdash;fell back and left<br /></span>
<span>A field of bloody agony and death<br /></span>
<span>About the base, and victory on the hill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I lost a score of riflemen that night;<br /></span>
<span>My first lieutenant&mdash;his last battle over&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Lay cut in twain upon the battle-line.<br /></span>
<span>With lantern dim wide o'er the slaughter-field<br /></span>
<span>I searched at midnight for my wounded men,<br /></span>
<span>But chiefly searched for Paul. An hour or more<br /></span>
<span>I sought among the groaning and the dead,<br /></span>
<span>Stooping and to the dim light turning up<br /></span>
<span>The ghastly faces, till at last I found<br /></span>
<span>Him whom I sought, and on the outer line&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Feet to the foe and silent face to heaven&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Death pale and bleeding from a ragged wound<br /></span>
<span>Pleading with feeble voice to let him be<br /></span>
<span>And die upon the field, we bore him thence;<br /></span>
<span>And tenderly his comrades carried him,<br /></span>
<span>Sheltered with blankets, on the weary march<br /></span>
<span>At dead of night in dismal storm begun.<br /></span>
<span>We made a stand at Harrison's, and there<br /></span>
<span>With careful hands we laid him on a cot.<br /></span>
<span>Now I had learned to prize the noble boy;<br /></span>
<span>My heart was touched with pity. Patiently<br /></span>
<span>I watched o'er Paul and bathed his fevered brow,<br /></span>
<span>And pressed the cooling sponge upon his lips,<br /></span>
<span>And washed his wound and gave him nourishment.<br /></span>
<span>'Twas all in vain, the surgeon said. I felt<br /></span>
<span>That I could save him and I kept my watch.<br /></span>
<span>A rib was crushed&mdash;beneath it one could see<br /></span>
<span>The throbbing vitals&mdash;torn as we supposed,<br /></span>
<span>But found unwounded. In his feverish sleep<br /></span>
<span>He often moaned and muttered mysteries,<br /></span>
<span>And, dreaming, spoke in low and tender tones<br /></span>
<span>As if some loved one sat beside his cot.<br /></span>
<span>I questioned him and sought the secret key<br /></span>
<span>To solve his mystery, but all in vain.<br /></span>
<span>A month of careful nursing turned the scale,<br /></span>
<span>And he began to gain upon his wound.<br /></span>
<span>Propt in his cot one evening as he sat<br /></span>
<span>And I sat by him, thus I questioned him:<br /></span>
<span>'There is a mystery about your life<br /></span>
<span>That I would gladly fathom. Paul, I think<br /></span>
<span>You well may trust me, and I fain would hear<br /></span>
<span>The story of your life; right well I know<br /></span>
<span>There is a secret sorrow in your heart.'<br /></span>

<span>&quot;He turned his face and fixed his lustrous eyes<br /></span>
<span>Upon mine own inquiringly, and held<br /></span>
<span>His gaze upon me till his vacant stare<br /></span>
<span>Told me full well his thoughts had wandered back<br /></span>
<span>Into the depth of his own silent soul;<br /></span>
<span>Then he looked down and sadly smiled and said:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;'Captain, I have no history&mdash;not one page;<br /></span>
<span>My book of life is but a blotted blank.<br /></span>
<span>Let it be sealed; I would not open it,<br /></span>
<span>Even to one who saved a worthless life,<br /></span>
<span>Only to add a few more leaves in blank<br /></span>
<span>To the blank volume. All that I now am<br /></span>
<span>I offer to my country. If I live<br /></span>

<span>I hope to die and leave no name behind.<br /></span>
<span>My only wish is this&mdash;for what I am,<br /></span>
<span>Or have been, or have hoped to be, is now<br /></span>
<span>A blank misfortune. I will say no more.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I questioned Paul and pressed him further still<br /></span>
<span>To tell his story, but he only shook<br /></span>
<span>His head in silence sadly and lay back<br /></span>
<span>And closed his eyes and whispered&mdash;'All is blank.'<br /></span>
<span>That night he muttered often in his sleep;<br /></span>
<span>I could not catch the sense of what he said;<br /></span>
<span>I caught a name that he repeated oft&mdash;<br /></span>
<span><i>Pauline</i>&mdash;so softly whispered that I knew<br /></span>
<span>She was the blissful burden of his dreams.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Two moons had waxed and waned, and Paul arose,<br /></span>
<span>Came to the camp and shared my tent and bed.<br /></span>
<span>While in the hospital he helpless lay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>To him unknown, and as the choice of all&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Came his promotion to the vacant rank<br /></span>
<span>Of him who fell at Malvern. But, alas,<br /></span>
<span>Say what we would he would not take the place.<br /></span>
<span>To us who importuned him, he replied:<br /></span>
<span>'Comrades and friends, I did not join your ranks<br /></span>
<span>For honor or for profit. All I am&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A wreck perhaps of what I might have been&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>I freely offer in our country's cause;<br /></span>
<span>And in her cause it is my wish to serve<br /></span>
<span>A private soldier; I aspire to naught<br /></span>
<span>But victory&mdash;and there be better men&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Braver and hardier&mdash;such should have the place.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;His comrades cheered, but Paul, methought, was sad.<br /></span>
<span>One evening as he sat upon his couch,<br /></span>
<span>Communing with himself as he was wont,<br /></span>
<span>I stood before him; looking in his face,<br /></span>
<span>I said, '<i>Pauline</i>&mdash;her name is then, <i>Pauline</i>.'<br /></span>
<span>All of a sudden up he rose amazed,<br /></span>
<span>And looked upon me with such startled eyes<br /></span>
<span>That I was pained and feared that I had done<br /></span>
<span>A wrong to him whom I had learned to love.<br /></span>
<span>Then he sat down upon his couch and groaned,<br /></span>
<span>Pressing his hand upon his wound, and said:<br /></span>
<span>'Captain, I pray you, tell me truthfully,<br /></span>
<span>Wherefore you speak that name.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">&quot;I told him all<br /></span>
<span>That I had heard him mutter in his dreams.<br /></span>
<span>He listened calmly to the close and said:<br /></span>
<span>'My friend, if you have any kind regard<br /></span>
<span>For me who suffer more than you may know,<br /></span>
<span>I pray you utter not that name again.'<br /></span>
<span>And thereupon he turned and hid his face.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;There was a mystery I might not fathom,<br /></span>
<span>There was a history I might not hear:<br /></span>

<span>Thereafter Paul was tenant of my tent&mdash;<br /></span>

<span>And wait and watch for vantage in attack;<br /></span>
<span>So on their bannered hills the opposing hosts,<br /></span>
<span>Eager to grapple in the tug of death,<br /></span>
<span>Waited and watched for vantage in the fight.<br /></span>
<span>Noon came. The fire of pickets died away.<br /></span>
<span>All eyes were turned to Seminary Ridge,<br /></span>
<span>For lo our sullen foemen&mdash;park on park&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Had massed their grim artillery on our corps.<br /></span>
<span>Hoarse voices sunk to whispers or were hushed;<br /></span>
<span>The rugged hills stood listening in awe;<br /></span>
<span>So dread the ominous silence that I heard<br /></span>
<span>The hearts of soldiers throbbing along the line.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Up from yon battery curled a cloud of smoke,<br /></span>
<span>Shrieked o'er our heads a solitary shell,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Then instantly in horrid concert roared<br /></span>
<span>Two hundred cannon on the Rebel hills&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Hurling their hissing thunderbolts&mdash;and then<br /></span>
<span>An hundred bellowing cannon from our lines<br /></span>
<span>Thundered their iron answer. Horrible<br /></span>
<span>Rolled in the heavens the infernal thunders&mdash;rolled<br /></span>
<span>From hill to hill the reverberating roar,<br /></span>
<span>As if the earth were bursting with the throes<br /></span>
<span>Of some vast pent volcano; rocked and reeled,<br /></span>
<span>As in an earthquake-shock, the solid hills;<br /></span>
<span>Anon huge fragments of the hillside rocks,<br /></span>
<span>And limbs and splinters of shot-shattered trees<br /></span>
<span>Danced in the smoke like demons; hissed and howled<br /></span>
<span>The crashing shell-storm bursting over us.<br /></span>
<span>Prone on the earth awaiting the grand charge,<br /></span>
<span>To which we knew the heavy cannonade<br /></span>
<span>Was but a prelude, for two hours we lay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Two hours that tried the very souls of men&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And many a brave man never rose again.<br /></span>
<span>Then ceased our guns to swell the infernal roar;<br /></span>
<span>The roll and crash of cannon in our front<br /></span>
<span>Lulled, and we heard the foeman's bugle-calls.<br /></span>
<span>Then from the slopes of Seminary Ridge<br /></span>
<span>Poured down the storming columns of the foe.<br /></span>
<span>As when the rain-clouds from the rim of heaven<br /></span>
<span>Are gathered by the four contending winds,<br /></span>
<span>And madly whirled until they meet and clash<br /></span>
<span>Above the hills and burst&mdash;down pours a sea<br /></span>
<span>And plunges roaring down through gorge and glen,<br /></span>
<span>So poured the surging columns of our foes<br /></span>
<span>Adown the slopes and spread along the vale<br /></span>
<span>In glittering ranks of battle&mdash;line on line&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Mile-long. Above the roar of cannon rose<br /></span>
<span>In one wild yell the Rebel battle-cry.<br /></span>
<span>Flash in the sun their serried ranks of steel;<br /></span>
<span>Before them swarm a cloud of skirmishers.<br /></span>
<span>That eager host the gallant Pickett leads;<br /></span>
<span>He right and left his fiery charger wheels;<br /></span>
<span>Steadies the lines with clarion voice; anon<br /></span>
<span>His outstretched saber gleaming points the way.<br /></span>
<span>As mid the myriad twinkling stars of heaven<br /></span>
<span>Flashes the blazing comet, and a column<br /></span>
<span>Of fiery fury follows it, so flashed<br /></span>
<span>The dauntless chief, so followed his wild host.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;We waited grim and silent till they crossed<br /></span>
<span>The center and began the dread ascent.<br /></span>
<span>Then brazen bugles rang the clarion call;<br /></span>
<span>Arose as one twice twenty thousand men,<br /></span>
<span>And all our hillsides blazed with crackling fire.<br /></span>
<span>With sudden crash and simultaneous roar<br /></span>
<span>An hundred cannon opened instantly,<br /></span>
<span>And all the vast hills shuddered under us.<br /></span>
<span>Yelling their mad defiance to our fire<br /></span>
<span>Still on and upward came our daring foes.<br /></span>
<span>As when upon the wooded mountain-side<br /></span>
<span>The unchained Loki<a name='FNanchor_D'></a><a href='#Footnote_D'><sup>[D]</sup></a> riots and the winds<br /></span>
<span>Of an autumnal tempest lash the flames,<br /></span>
<span>Whirling the burning fragments through the air&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Huge blazing limbs and tops of blasted pines&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Mowing wide swaths with circling scythes of fire,<br /></span>
<span>So fell our fire upon the advancing host,<br /></span>
<span>And lashed their ranks and mowed them into heaps,<br /></span>
<span>Cleaving broad avenues of death. Still on<br /></span>
<span>And up they come undaunted, closing up<br /></span>
<span>The ghastly gaps and firing as they come.<br /></span>
<span>As if protected by the hand of heaven,<br /></span>
<span>Rides at their head their gallant leader still;<br /></span>
<span>The tempest drowns his voice&mdash;his naming sword<br /></span>
<span>Gleams in the flash of rifles. One wild yell&mdash;Like<br /></span>
<span>the mad hunger-howl of famished wolves<br /></span>
<span>Midwinter on the flying cabris'<a name='FNanchor_E'></a><a href='#Footnote_E'><sup>[E]</sup></a> trail,<br /></span>
<span>Swelled by ten thousand hideous voices, shrills,<br /></span>
<span>And through the battle-smoke the bravest burst.<br /></span>
<span>Flutters their tattered banner on our wall!<br /></span>
<span>Thunders their shout of victory! Appalled<br /></span>
<span>Our serried ranks are broken&mdash;but in vain!<br /></span>
<span>On either hand our cannon enfilade,<br /></span>
<span>Crushing great gaps along the stalwart lines;<br /></span>
<span>In front our deadly rifles volley still,<br /></span>
<span>Mowing the toppling swaths of daring men.<br /></span>
<span>Behold&mdash;they falter!&mdash;Ho!&mdash;they break!&mdash;they fly!<br /></span>
<span>With one wild cheer that shakes the solid hills<br /></span>
<span>Spring to the charge our eager infantry.<br /></span>
<span>Headlong we press them down the bloody slope,<br /></span>
<span>Headlong they fall before our leveled steel<br /></span>
<span>And break in wild disorder, cast away<br /></span>
<span>Their arms and fly in panic. All the vale<br /></span>
<span>Is spread with slaughter and wild fugitives.<br /></span>
<span>Wide o'er the field the scattered foemen fly;<br /></span>
<span>Dread havoc and mad terror swift pursue<br /></span>
<span>Till battle is but slaughter. Thousands fall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Thousands surrender, and the Southern flag<br /></span>
<span>Is trailed upon the field.<br /></span>

<span class="i14">&quot;The day was ours,<br /></span>
<span>And well we knew the worth of victory.<br /></span>
<span>Loud rolled the rounds of cheers from corps to corps;<br /></span>
<span>Comrades embraced each other; iron men<br /></span>
<span>Shed tears of joy like women; men profane<br /></span>
<span>Fell on their knees and thanked Almighty God.<br /></span>
<span>Then <i>'Hail Columbia'</i> rang the brazen horns,<br /></span>
<span>And all the hill-tops shouted unto heaven;<br /></span>
<span>The welkin shouted to the shouting hills&mdash;And<br /></span>
<span>heavens and hill-tops shouted <i>'Victory!'</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Night with her pall had wrapped the bloody field.<br /></span>
<span>The little remnants of our regiment<br /></span>
<span>Were gathered and encamped upon the hill.<br /></span>
<span>Paul was not with them, and they could not tell<br /></span>
<span>Aught of him. I had seen him in the fight<br /></span>
<span>Bravest of all the brave. I saw him last<br /></span>
<span>When first the foremost foemen reached our wall,<br /></span>
<span>Thrusting them off with bloody bayonet,<br /></span>
<span>And shouting to his comrades, <i>'Steady, men!'</i><br /></span>
<span>Sadly I wandered back where we had met<br /></span>
<span>The onset of the foe. The rounds of cheers<br /></span>
<span>Repeated oft still swept from corps to corps,<br /></span>
<span>And as I passed along the line I saw<br /></span>
<span>Our dying comrades raise their weary heads,<br /></span>
<span>And cheer with feeble voices. Even in death<br /></span>
<span>The cry of victory warmed their hearts again.<br /></span>
<span>Paul lay upon the ground where he had fought,<br /></span>
<span>Fast by the flag that floated on the line.<br /></span>
<span>He slept&mdash;or seemed to sleep, but on his brow<br /></span>
<span>Sat such a deadly pallor that I feared<br /></span>
<span>My Paul would never march and fight again.<br /></span>
<span>I raised his head&mdash;he woke as from a dream;<br /></span>
<span>I said, 'Be quiet&mdash;you are badly hurt;<br /></span>
<span>I'll call a surgeon; we will dress your wound.'<br /></span>
<span class="i14">He gravely said:<br /></span>

<h3>PART II</h3>

<h4>PAUL' S HISTORY</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Captain, I hear the cheers. My soul is glad.<br /></span>
<span>My days are numbered, but this glorious day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Like some far beacon on a shadowy cape<br /></span>
<span>That cheers at night the storm-belabored ships&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Will light the misty ages from afar.<br /></span>
<span>This field shall be the Mecca. Here shall rise<br /></span>
<span>A holier than the Caaba where men kiss<br /></span>
<span>The sacred stone that flaming fell from heaven.<br /></span>
<span>But O how many sad and aching hearts<br /></span>
<span>Will mourn the loved ones never to return!<br /></span>
<span>Thank God&mdash;no heart will hope for my return!<br /></span>
<span>Thank God&mdash;no heart will mourn because I die!<br /></span>
<span>Captain, at life's mid-summer flush and glow,<br /></span>
<span>For him to die who leaves his golden hopes,<br /></span>
<span>His mourning friends and idol-love behind,<br /></span>
<span>It must be hard and seem a cruel thing.<br /></span>
<span>After the victory&mdash;upon this field&mdash;For<br /></span>
<span>me to die hath more of peace than pain;<br /></span>
<span>For I shall leave no golden hopes behind,<br /></span>
<span>No idol-love to pine because I die,<br /></span>
<span>No friends to wait my coming or to mourn.<br /></span>
<span>They wait my coming in the world beyond;<br /></span>
<span>And wait not long, for I am almost there.<br /></span>
<span>'Tis but a gasp, and I shall pass the bound<br /></span>
<span>'Twixt life and death&mdash;through death to life again&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Where sorrow cometh never. Pangs and pains<br /></span>
<span>Of flesh or spirit will not pierce me there;<br /></span>
<span>And two will greet me from the jasper walls&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>God's angels&mdash;with a song of holy peace,<br /></span>
<span>And haste to meet me at the pearly gate,<br /></span>
<span>And kiss the death-damp from my silent lips,<br /></span>
<span>And lead me through the golden avenues&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Singing Hosanna&mdash;to the Great White Throne.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>So there he paused and calmly closed his eyes,<br /></span>
<span>And silently I sat and held his hand.<br /></span>
<span>After a time, when we were left alone,<br /></span>
<span>He spoke again with calmer voice and said:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Captain, you oft have asked my history,<br /></span>
<span>And I as oft refused. There is no cause<br /></span>
<span>Why I should longer hold it from my friend<br /></span>
<span>Who reads the closing chapter. It may teach<br /></span>
<span>One soul to lean upon the arm of Christ&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>That hope and happiness find anchorage<br /></span>
<span>Only in heaven. While my lonesome life<br /></span>
<span>Saw death but dimly in the dull distance<br /></span>
<span>My lips were sealed to the unhappy tale;<br /></span>
<span>Under my pride I hid a heavy heart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I was ambitious in my boyhood days,<br /></span>
<span>And dreamed of fame and honors&mdash;misty fogs<br /></span>
<span>That climb at morn the ragged cliffs of life,<br /></span>
<span>Veiling the ragged rocks and gloomy chasms,<br /></span>
<span>And shaping airy castles on the top<br /></span>
<span>With bristling battlements and looming towers;<br /></span>
<span>But melt away into ethereal air<br /></span>
<span>Beneath the blaze of the mid-summer sun,<br /></span>
<span>Till cliffs and chasms and all the ragged rocks<br /></span>
<span>Are bare, and all the castles crumbled away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;There winds a river 'twixt two chains of hills&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Fir-capped and rugged monuments of time;<br /></span>
<span>A level vale of rich alluvial land,<br /></span>
<span>Washed from the slopes through circling centuries,<br /></span>
<span>And sweet with clover and the hum of bees,<br /></span>
<span>Lies broad between the rugged, somber hills.<br /></span>
<span>Beneath a shade of willows and of elms<br /></span>
<span>The river slumbers in this meadowy lap.<br /></span>
<span>Down from the right there winds a babbling branch,<br /></span>
<span>Cleaving a narrower valley through the hills.<br /></span>
<span>A grand bald-headed hill-cone on the right<br /></span>
<span>Looms like a patriarch, and above the branch<br /></span>
<span>There towers another. I have seen the day<br /></span>
<span>When those bald heads were plumed with lofty pines.<br /></span>
<span>Below the branch and near the river bank,<br /></span>
<span>Hidden among the elms and butternuts,<br /></span>
<span>The dear old cottage stands where I was born.<br /></span>
<span>An English ivy clambers to the eaves;<br /></span>
<span>An English willow planted by my hand<br /></span>
<span>Now spreads its golden branches o'er the roof<br /></span>
<span>Not far below the cottage thrives a town,<br /></span>
<span>A busy town of mills and merchandise&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Belle Meadows, fairest village of the vale.<br /></span>
<span>Behind it looms the hill-cone, and in front<br /></span>
<span>The peaceful river winds its silent way.<br /></span>
<span>Beyond the river spreads a level plain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Once hid with somber firs&mdash;a tangled marsh&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Now beautiful with fields and cottages,<br /></span>
<span>And sweet in spring-time with the blooming plum,<br /></span>
<span>And white with apple-blossoms blown like snow.<br /></span>
<span>Beyond the plain a lower chain of hills,<br /></span>
<span>In summer gemmed with fields of golden grain<br /></span>
<span>Set in the emerald of the beechen woods.<br /></span>
<span>In other days the village school-house stood<br /></span>
<span>Below our cottage on a grassy mound<br /></span>
<span>That sloped away unto the river's marge;<br /></span>
<span>And on the slope a cluster of tall pines<br /></span>
<span>Crowning a copse of beech and evergreen.<br /></span>
<span>There in my boyhood days I went to school;<br /></span>
<span>A maiden mistress ruled the little realm;<br /></span>
<span>She taught the rudiments to rompish rogues,<br /></span>
<span>And walked a queen with magic wand of birch.<br /></span>
<span>My years were hardly ten when father died.<br /></span>
<span>Sole tenants of our humble cottage home<br /></span>
<span>My sorrowing mother and myself remained;<br /></span>
<span>But she was all economy, and kept<br /></span>
<span>With my poor aid a comfortable house.<br /></span>
<span>I was her idol and she wrought at night<br /></span>
<span>To keep me at my books, and used to boast<br /></span>
<span>That I should rise above our humble lot.<br /></span>
<span>How oft I listened to her hopeful words&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Poured from the fountain of a mother's heart<br /></span>
<span>Until I longed to wing the sluggard years<br /></span>
<span>That bore me on to what I hoped to be.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;We had a garden-plat behind the house&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Beyond, an orchard and a pasture-lot;<br /></span>
<span>In front a narrow meadow&mdash;here and there<br /></span>
<span>Shaded with elms and branching butternuts.<br /></span>
<span>In spring and summer in the garden-plat<br /></span>
<span>I wrought my morning and my evening hours<br /></span>
<span>And kept myself at school&mdash;no idle boy.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;One bright May morning when the robins sang<br /></span>
<span>There came to school a stranger queenly fair,<br /></span>
<span>With eyes that shamed the ethereal blue of heaven,<br /></span>
<span>And golden hair in ringlets&mdash;cheeks as soft,<br /></span>
<span>As fresh and rosy as the velvet blush<br /></span>
<span>Of summer sunrise on the dew-damp hills.<br /></span>
<span>Hers was the name I muttered in my dreams.<br /></span>
<span>For days my bashful heart held me aloof<br /></span>
<span>Although her senior by a single year;<br /></span>
<span>But we were brought together oft in class,<br /></span>
<span>And when she learned my name she spoke to me,<br /></span>
<span>And then my tongue was loosed and we were friends.<br /></span>
<span>Before the advent of the steeds of steel<br /></span>
<span>Her sire&mdash;a shrewd and calculating man&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Had lately come and purchased timbered-lands<br /></span>
<span>And idle mills, and made the town his home.<br /></span>
<span>And he was well-to-do and growing rich,<br /></span>
<span>And she her father's pet and only child.<br /></span>
<span>In mind and stature for two happy years<br /></span>
<span>We grew together at the village school.<br /></span>
<span>We grew together!&mdash;aye, our tender hearts<br /></span>
<span>There grew together till they beat as one.<br /></span>
<span>Her tasks were mine, and mine alike were hers;<br /></span>
<span>We often stole away among the pines&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>That stately cluster on the sloping hill&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And conned our lessons from the selfsame book,<br /></span>
<span>And learned to love each other o'er our tasks,<br /></span>
<span>While in the pine-tops piped the oriole,<br /></span>
<span>And from his branch the chattering squirrel chid<br /></span>
<span>Our guileless love and artless innocence.<br /></span>
<span>'Twas childish love perhaps, but day by day<br /></span>
<span>It grew into our souls as we grew up.<br /></span>
<span>Then there was opened in the prospering town<br /></span>
<span>A grammar school, and thither went Pauline.<br /></span>
<span>I missed her and was sad for many a day,<br /></span>
<span>Till mother gave me leave to follow her.<br /></span>
<span>In autumn&mdash;in vacation&mdash;she would come<br /></span>
<span>With girlish pretext to our cottage home.<br /></span>
<span>She often brought my mother little gifts,<br /></span>
<span>And cheered her with sweet songs and happy words;<br /></span>
<span>And I would pluck the fairest meadow-flowers<br /></span>
<span>To grace a garland for her golden hair,<br /></span>
<span>And fill her basket from the butternuts<br /></span>
<span>That flourished in our little meadow field.<br /></span>
<span>I found in her all I had dreamed of heaven.<br /></span>
<span>So garlanded with latest-blooming flowers,<br /></span>
<span>Chanting the mellow music of our hopes,<br /></span>
<span>The silver-sandaled Autumn-hours tripped by.<br /></span>
<span>And mother learned to love her; but she feared,<br /></span>
<span>Knowing her heart and mine, that one rude hand<br /></span>
<span>Might break our hopes asunder. Like a thief<br /></span>
<span>I often crept about her father's house,<br /></span>
<span>Under the evening shadows, eager-eyed,<br /></span>
<span>Peering for one dear face, and lingered late<br /></span>
<span>To catch the silver music of one voice<br /></span>
<span>That from her chamber nightly rose to heaven.<br /></span>
<span>Her father's face I feared&mdash;a silent man,<br /></span>
<span>Cold-faced, imperative, by nature prone<br /></span>
<span>To set his will against the beating world;<br /></span>
<span>Warm-hearted but heart-crusted.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;After the sad and solemn funeral,<br /></span>
<span>Alone and weeping and disconsolate,<br /></span>
<span>I sat at evening by the cottage door.<br /></span>
<span>I felt as if a dark and bitter fate<br /></span>
<span>Had fallen on me in my tender years.<br /></span>
<span>I seemed an aimless wanderer doomed to grope<br /></span>
<span>In vain among the darkling years and die.<br /></span>
<span>One only star shone through the shadowy mists.<br /></span>
<span>The moon that wandered in the gloomy heavens<br /></span>
<span>Was robed in shrouds; the rugged, looming hills<br /></span>
<span>Looked desolate;&mdash;the silent river seemed<br /></span>
<span>A somber chasm, while my own pet lamb,<br /></span>
<span>Mourning disconsolate among the trees,<br /></span>
<span>As if he followed some dim phantom-form,<br /></span>
<span>Bleated in vain and would not heed my call.<br /></span>
<span>On weary hands I bent my weary head;<br /></span>
<span>In gloomy sadness fell my silent tears.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;An angel's hand was laid upon my head&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>There in the moonlight stood my own Pauline&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Angel of love and hope and holy faith&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>She flashed upon me bowed in bitter grief,<br /></span>
<span>As falls the meteor down the night-clad heavens&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>In silence. Then about my neck she clasped<br /></span>
<span>Her loving arms and on my shoulder drooped<br /></span>
<span>Her golden tresses, while her silent tears<br /></span>
<span>Fell warm upon my cheek like summer rain.<br /></span>
<span>Heart clasped to heart and cheek to cheek we sat;<br /></span>
<span>The moon no longer gloomed&mdash;her face was cheer;<br /></span>
<span>The rugged hills were old-time friends again;<br /></span>
<span>The peaceful river slept beneath the moon,<br /></span>
<span>And my pet lamb came bounding to our side<br /></span>
<span>And kissed her hand and mine as he was wont.<br /></span>
<span>Then I awoke as from a dream and said:<br /></span>
<span>'Tell me, beloved, why you come to me<br /></span>
<span>In this dark hour&mdash;so late&mdash;so desolate?'<br /></span>
<span>And she replied:<br /></span>

<span>My mother hoped that I would work my way<br /></span>
<span>To competence and honor at the bar.<br /></span>
<span>But shall I toil in poverty for years<br /></span>
<span>To learn a science that so seldom yields<br /></span>
<span>Or wealth or honor save to silvered heads?<br /></span>
<span>I know that path to fame and fortune leads<br /></span>
<span>Through thorns and brambles over ragged rocks;<br /></span>
<span>But can I follow in the common path<br /></span>
<span>Trod by the millions, never to lift my head<br /></span>
<span>Above the busy hordes that delve and drudge<br /></span>
<span>For bare existence in this bitter world&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And be a mite, a midge, a worthless worm,<br /></span>
<span>No more distinguished from the common mass<br /></span>
<span>Than one poor polyp in the coral isle<br /></span>
<span>Is marked amid the myriads teeming there?<br /></span>
<span>Yet 'tis not for myself. For you, Pauline,<br /></span>
<span>Far up the slippery heights of wealth and fame<br /></span>
<span>Would I climb bravely; but if I would climb<br /></span>
<span>By any art or science, I must train<br /></span>
<span>Unto the task my feet for many years,<br /></span>
<span>Else I should slip and fall from rugged ways,<br /></span>
<span>Too badly bruised to ever mount again.'<br /></span>
<span>Then she:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;'O Paul, if wealth were mine to give!<br /></span>
<span>O if my father could but know my heart!<br /></span>
<span>But fear not, Paul, our <i>Father</i> reigns in heaven.<br /></span>
<span>Follow your bent&mdash;'twill lead you out aright;<br /></span>
<span>The highest mountain lessens as we climb;<br /></span>
<span>Persistent courage wins the smile of fate.<br /></span>
<span>Apply yourself to law and master it,<br /></span>
<span>And I will wait. This sad and solemn hour<br /></span>
<span>Is dark with doubt and gloom, but by and by<br /></span>
<span>The clouds will lift and you will see God's face.<br /></span>
<span>For there is one in heaven whose pleading tongue<br /></span>
<span>Will pray for blessings on her only son<br /></span>
<span>Of Him who heeds the little sparrow's fall;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And O if He will listen to my prayers,<br /></span>
<span>The gates of heaven shall echo to my voice<br /></span>
<span>Morning and evening,&mdash;only keep your heart.'<br /></span>
<span>I said:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;'Pauline, your prayers had rolled away<br /></span>
<span>The ponderous stone that closed the tomb of Christ;<br /></span>
<span>And while they rise to heaven for my success<br /></span>
<span>I cannot doubt, or I should doubt my God.<br /></span>
<span>I think I see a pathway through this gloom;<br /></span>
<span>I have a kinsman'&mdash;and I told her where&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'A lawyer; I have heard my mother say&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A self-made man with charitable heart;<br /></span>
<span>And I might go and study under him;<br /></span>
<span>I think he would assist me.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&quot;Then she sighed:<br /></span>
<span>'Paul, can you leave me? You may study here<br /></span>
<span>And here you are among your boyhood friends,<br /></span>
<span>And here I should be near to cheer you on.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I promised her that I would think of it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Would see what prospect offered in the town;<br /></span>
<span>And then we walked together half-embraced,<br /></span>
<span>But when we neared her vine-arched garden gate,<br /></span>
<span>She bade me stay and kissed me a good-night<br /></span>
<span>And bounded through the moonlight like a fawn.<br /></span>
<span>I watched her till she flitted from my sight,<br /></span>
<span>Then slowly homeward turned my lingering steps.<br /></span>
<span>I wrote my kinsman on the morrow morn,<br /></span>
<span>And broached my project to a worthy man<br /></span>
<span>Who kept an office and a case of books&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>An honest lawyer. People called him learn'd,<br /></span>
<span>But wanting tact and ready speech he failed.<br /></span>
<span>The rest were pettifoggers&mdash;scurrilous rogues<br /></span>
<span>Who plied the village justice with their lies,<br /></span>
<span>And garbled law to suit the case in hand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Mean, querulous, small-brained delvers in the mire<br /></span>
<span>Of men's misfortunes&mdash;crafty, cunning knaves,<br /></span>
<span>Versed in chicane and trickery that schemed<br /></span>
<span>To keep the evil passions of weak men<br /></span>
<span>In petty wars, and plied their tongues profane<br /></span>
<span>With cunning words to argue honest fools<br /></span>
<span>Into their spider-meshes to be fleeced.<br /></span>
<span>I laid my case before him; took advice&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Well-meant advice&mdash;to leave my native town,<br /></span>
<span>And study with my kinsman whom he knew.<br /></span>
<span>A week rolled round and brought me a reply&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A frank and kindly letter&mdash;giving me<br /></span>
<span>That which I needed most&mdash;encouragement.<br /></span>
<span>But hard it was to fix my mind to go;<br /></span>
<span>For in my heart an angel whispered 'Stay.'<br /></span>
<span>It might be better for my after years,<br /></span>
<span>And yet perhaps,'twere better to remain.<br /></span>
<span>I balanced betwixt my reason and my heart,<br /></span>
<span>And hesitated. Her I had not seen<br /></span>
<span>Since that sad night, and so I made resolve<br /></span>
<span>That we should meet, and at her father's house.<br /></span>
<span>So whispering courage to my timid heart<br /></span>
<span>I went. With happy greeting at the door<br /></span>
<span>She met me, but her face was wan and pale&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>So pale and wan I feared that she was ill.<br /></span>
<span>I read the letter to her, and she sighed,<br /></span>
<span>And sat in silence for a little time,<br /></span>
<span>Then said:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;'God bless you, Paul, may be 'tis best&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>I sometimes feel it is not for the best,<br /></span>
<span>But I am selfish&mdash;thinking of myself.<br /></span>
<span>Go like a man, but keep your boyish heart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Your boyish heart is all the world to me.<br /></span>
<span>Remember, Paul, how I shall watch and wait;<br /></span>
<span>So write me often: like the dew of heaven<br /></span>
<span>To withering grass will come your cheering words.<br /></span>
<span>To know that you are well and happy, Paul,<br /></span>
<span>And good and true, will wing the weary months.<br /></span>
<span>And let me beg you as a sister would&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Not that I doubt you but because I love&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Beware of wine&mdash;touch not the treacherous cup,<br /></span>
<span>And guard your honor as you guard your life.<br /></span>
<span>The years will glide away like scudding clouds<br /></span>
<span>That fleetly chase each other o'er the hills,<br /></span>
<span>And you will be a man before you know,<br /></span>
<span>And I will be a woman. God will crown<br /></span>
<span>Our dearest hopes if we but trust in Him.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;We sat in silence for a little time,<br /></span>
<span>And she was weeping, so I raised her face<br /></span>
<span>And kissed away her tears. She softly said:<br /></span>
<span>'Paul, there is something I must say to you&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Something I have no time to tell you now;<br /></span>
<span>But we must meet again before you go&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Under the pines where we so oft have met.<br /></span>
<span>Be this the sign,'&mdash;She waved her graceful hand,<br /></span>
<span>'Come when the shadows gather on the pines,<br /></span>
<span>And silent stars stand sentinel in heaven;<br /></span>
<span>Now Paul, forgive me&mdash;I must say&mdash;good-bye.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I read her fear upon her anxious brow.<br /></span>
<span>Lingering and clasped within her loving arms<br /></span>
<span>I, through her dewy, deep, blue eyes, beheld<br /></span>
<span>Her inmost soul, and knew that love was there.<br /></span>
<span>Ah, then and there her father blustered in,<br /></span>
<span>And caught us blushing in each other's arms!<br /></span>
<span>He stood a moment silent and amazed:<br /></span>
<span>Then kindling wrath distorted all his face,<br /></span>
<span>He showered his anger with a tongue of fire.<br /></span>
<span>O cruel words that stung my boyish pride!<br /></span>
<span>O dagger words that stabbed my very soul!<br /></span>
<span>I strove, but fury mastered&mdash;up I sprang,<br /></span>
<span>And felt a giant as I stood before him.<br /></span>
<span>My breath was hot with anger;&mdash;impious boy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Frenzied&mdash;forgetful of his silvered hairs&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Forgetful of her presence, too, I raved,<br /></span>
<span>And poured a madman's curses on his head.<br /></span>
<span>A moan of anguish brought me to myself;<br /></span>
<span>I turned and saw her sad, imploring face,<br /></span>
<span>And tears that quenched the wild fire in my heart.<br /></span>
<span>I pressed her hand and passed into the hall,<br /></span>
<span>While she stood sobbing in a flood of tears,<br /></span>
<span>And he stood choked with anger and amazed.<br /></span>
<span>But as I passed the ivied porch he came<br /></span>
<span>With bated breath and muttered in my ear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'<i>Beggar!</i>'&mdash;It stung me like a serpent's fang.<br /></span>
<span>Pride-pricked and muttering like a maniac,<br /></span>
<span>I almost flew the street and hurried home<br /></span>
<span>To vent my anger to the silent elms.<br /></span>
<span><i>'Beggar!</i>'&mdash;an hundred times that long, mad night<br /></span>
<span>I muttered with hot lips and burning breath;<br /></span>
<span>I paced the walk with hurried tread, and raved;<br /></span>
<span>I threw myself beneath the willow-tree,<br /></span>
<span>And muttered like the muttering of a storm.<br /></span>
<span>My little lamb came bleating mournfully;<br /></span>
<span>Angered I struck him;&mdash;out among the trees<br /></span>
<span>I wandered mumbling 'beggar' as I went,<br /></span>
<span>And beating in through all my burning soul<br /></span>
<span>The bitter thoughts it conjured, till my brain<br /></span>
<span>Reeled and I sunk upon the dew-damp grass,<br /></span>
<span>And&mdash;utterly exhausted&mdash;slept till morn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I dreamed a dream&mdash;all mist and mystery.<br /></span>
<span>I saw a sunlit valley beautiful<br /></span>
<span>With purple vineyards and with garden-plats;<br /></span>
<span>And in the vineyards and the garden-plats<br /></span>
<span>Were happy-hearted youths and merry girls<br /></span>
<span>Toiling and singing. Grandsires too were there,<br /></span>
<span>Sitting contented under their own vines<br /></span>
<span>And fig-trees, while about them merrily played<br /></span>
<span>Their children's children like the sportive lambs<br /></span>
<span>That frolicked on the foot-hills. Low of kine,<br /></span>
<span>Full-uddered, homeward-wending from the meads,<br /></span>
<span>Fell on the ear as soft as Hulder's loor<br /></span>
<span>Tuned on the Norse-land mountains. Like a nest<br /></span>
<span>Hid in a hawthorn-hedge a cottage stood<br /></span>
<span>Embowered with vines beneath broad-branching elms<br /></span>
<span>Sweet-voiced with busy bees.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>[Illustration: PAUL'S DREAM]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&quot;On either hand<br /></span>
<span>Rose steep and barren mountains&mdash;mighty cliffs<br /></span>
<span>Cragged and chasm'd and over-grown with thorns;<br /></span>
<span>And on the topmost peak a golden throne<br /></span>
<span>Blazoned with burning characters that read&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'Climb'&mdash;it is yours.' Not far above the vale<br /></span>
<span>I saw a youth, fair-browed and raven-haired,<br /></span>
<span>Clambering among the thorns and ragged rocks;<br /></span>
<span>And from his brow with torn and bleeding hand<br /></span>
<span>He wiped great drops of sweat. Down through the vale<br /></span>
<span>I saw a rapid river, broad and deep,<br /></span>
<span>Winding in solemn silence to the sea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The sea all mist and fog. Lo as I stood<br /></span>
<span>Viewing the river and the moaning sea,<br /></span>
<span>A sail&mdash;and then another&mdash;flitted down<br /></span>
<span>And plunged into the mist. A moment more,<br /></span>
<span>Like shapeless shadows of the by-gone years,<br /></span>
<span>I saw them in the mist and they were gone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Gone!&mdash;and the sea moaned on and seemed to say&mdash;<br /></span>
<span><i>'Gone&mdash;and forever!</i>'&mdash;So I gladly turned<br /></span>
<span>To look upon the throne&mdash;the blazoned throne<br /></span>
<span>That sat upon the everlasting cliff.<br /></span>
<span>The throne had vanished!&mdash;Lo where it had stood,<br /></span>
<span>A bed of ashes and a gray-haired man<br /></span>
<span>Sitting upon it bowed and broken down.<br /></span>
<span>And so the vision passed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&quot;The rising sun<br /></span>
<span>Beamed full upon my face and wakened me,<br /></span>
<span>And there beside me lay my pet&mdash;the lamb&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Gazing upon me with his wondering eyes,<br /></span>
<span>And all the fields were bright and beautiful,<br /></span>
<span>And brighter seemed the world. I rose resolved.<br /></span>
<span>I let the cottage and disposed of all;<br /></span>
<span>The lamb went bleating to a neighbor's field;<br /></span>
<span>And oft my heart ached, but I mastered it.<br /></span>
<span>This was the constant burden of my brain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span><i>'Beggar!</i>'&mdash;I'll teach him that I am a man;<br /></span>
<span>I'll speak and he shall listen; I will rise,<br /></span>
<span>And he shall see my course as I go up<br /></span>
<span>Round after round the ladder of success.<br /></span>
<span>Even as the pine upon the mountain-top<br /></span>
<span>Towers o'er the maple on the mountain-side,<br /></span>
<span>I'll tower above him. Then will I look down<br /></span>
<span>And call him <i>Father</i>:&mdash;He shall call me <i>Son</i>.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Thus hushing my sad heart the day drew nigh<br /></span>
<span>Of parting, and the promised sign was given.<br /></span>
<span>The night was dismal darkness&mdash;not one star<br /></span>
<span>Twinkled in heaven; the sad, low-moaning wind<br /></span>
<span>Played like a mournful harp among the pines.<br /></span>
<span>I groped and listened through the darkling grove,<br /></span>
<span>Peering with eager eyes among the trees,<br /></span>
<span>And calling as I peered with anxious voice<br /></span>
<span>One darling name. No answer but the moan<br /></span>
<span>Of the wind-shaken pines. I sat me down<br /></span>
<span>Under the dusky shadows waiting for her,<br /></span>
<span>And lost myself in gloomy reverie.<br /></span>
<span>Dim in the darksome shadows of the night,<br /></span>
<span>While thus I dreamed, my darling came and crept<br /></span>
<span>Beneath the boughs as softly as a hare,<br /></span>
<span>And whispered 'Paul'&mdash;and I was at her side.<br /></span>
<span>We sat upon a mound moss-carpeted&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>No eyes but God's upon us, and no voice<br /></span>
<span>Spake to us save the moaning of the pines.<br /></span>
<span>Few were the words we spoke; her silent tears,<br /></span>
<span>Our clasping, trembling, lingering embrace,<br /></span>
<span>Were more than words. Into one solemn hour,<br /></span>
<span>Were pressed the fears and hopes of coming years.<br /></span>
<span>Two tender hearts that only dared to hope<br /></span>
<span>There swelled and throbbed to the electric touch<br /></span>
<span>Of love as holy as the love of Christ.<br /></span>
<span>She gave her picture and I gave a ring&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>My mother's&mdash;almost with her latest breath<br /></span>
<span>She gave it me and breathed my darling's name.<br /></span>
<span>I girt her finger, and she kissed the ring<br /></span>
<span>In solemn pledge, and said:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">&quot;'I bring a gift&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The priceless gift of God unto his own:<br /></span>
<span>O may it prove a precious gift to you,<br /></span>
<span>As it has proved a precious gift to me;<br /></span>
<span>And promise me to read it day by day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Beginning on the morrow&mdash;every day<br /></span>
<span>A chapter&mdash;and I too will read the same.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I took the gift&mdash;a precious gift indeed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And you may see how I have treasured it.<br /></span>
<span>Here, Captain, put your hand upon my breast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>An inner pocket&mdash;you will find it there.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>I opened the bloody blouse and thence drew forth<br /></span>
<span>The Book of Christ all stained with Christian blood.<br /></span>
<span>He laid his hand upon the holy book,<br /></span>
<span>And closed his eyes as if in silent prayer.<br /></span>
<span>I held his weary head and bade him rest.<br /></span>
<span>He lay a moment silent and resumed:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Let me go on if you would hear the tale;<br /></span>
<span>I soon shall sleep the sleep that wakes no more.<br /></span>
<span>O there were promises and vows as solemn<br /></span>
<span>As Christ's own promises; but as we sat<br /></span>
<span>The pattering rain-drops fell among the pines,<br /></span>
<span>And in the branches the foreboding owl<br /></span>
<span>With dismal hooting hailed the coming storm.<br /></span>
<span>So in that dreary hour and desolate<br /></span>
<span>We parted in the silence of our tears.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;And on the morrow morn I bade adieu<br /></span>
<span>To the old cottage home I loved so well&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The dear old cottage home where I was born.<br /></span>
<span>Then from my mother's grave I plucked a rose<br /></span>
<span>Bursting in bloom&mdash;Pauline had planted it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And left my little hill-girt boyhood world.<br /></span>
<span>I journeyed eastward to my journey's end;<br /></span>
<span>At first by rail for many a flying mile,<br /></span>
<span>By mail-coach thence from where the hurrying train<br /></span>
<span>Leaps a swift river that goes tumbling on<br /></span>
<span>Between a village and a mountain-ledge,<br /></span>
<span>Chafing its rocky banks. There seethes and foams<br /></span>
<span>The restless river round the roaring rocks,<br /></span>
<span>And then flows on a little way and pours<br /></span>
<span>Its laughing waters into a bridal lap.<br /></span>
<span>Its flood is fountain-fed among the hills;<br /></span>
<span>Far up the mossy brooks the timid trout<br /></span>
<span>Lie in the shadow of vine-tangled elms.<br /></span>
<span>Out from the village-green the roadway leads<br /></span>
<span>Along the river up between the hills,<br /></span>
<span>Then climbs a wooded mountain to its top,<br /></span>
<span>And gently winds adown the farther side<br /></span>
<span>Unto a valley where the bridal stream<br /></span>
<span>Flows rippling, meadow-flower-and-willow-fringed,<br /></span>
<span>And dancing onward with a merry song,<br /></span>
<span>Hastes to the nuptials. From the mountain-top&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A thousand feet above the meadowy vale&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>She seems a chain of fretted silver wound<br /></span>
<span>With artless art among the emerald hills.<br /></span>
<span>Thence up a winding valley of grand views&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Hill-guarded&mdash;firs and rocks upon the hills,<br /></span>
<span>And here and there a solitary pine<br /></span>
<span>Majestic&mdash;silent&mdash;mourns its slaughtered kin,<br /></span>
<span>Like the last warrior of some tawny tribe<br /></span>
<span>Returned from sunset mountains to behold<br /></span>
<span>Once more the spot where his brave fathers sleep.<br /></span>
<span>The farms along the valley stretch away<br /></span>
<span>On either hand upon the rugged hills&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Walled into fields. Tall elms and willow-trees<br /></span>
<span>Huge-trunked and ivy-hung stand sentinel<br /></span>
<span>Along the roadway walls&mdash;storm-wrinkled trees<br /></span>
<span>Planted by men who slumber on the hills.<br /></span>
<span>Amid such scenes all day we rolled along,<br /></span>
<span>And as the shadows of the western hills<br /></span>
<span>Across the valley crept and climbed the slopes,<br /></span>
<span>The sunset blazed their hazy tops and fell<br /></span>
<span>Upon the emerald like a mist of gold.<br /></span>
<span>And at that hour I reached my journey's end.<br /></span>
<span>The village is a gem among the hills&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Tall, towering hills that reach into the blue.<br /></span>
<span>One grand old mountain-cone looms on the left<br /></span>
<span>Far up toward heaven, and all around are hills.<br /></span>
<span>The river winds among the leafy hills<br /></span>
<span>Adown the meadowy dale; a shade of elms<br /></span>
<span>And willows fringe it. In this lap of hills<br /></span>
<span>Cluster the happy homes of men content<br /></span>
<span>To let the great world worry as it will.<br /></span>
<span>The court-house park, the broad, bloom-bordered streets,<br /></span>
<span>Are avenues of maples and of elms&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Grander than Tadmor's pillared avenue&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Fair as the fabled garden of the gods.<br /></span>
<span>Beautiful villas, tidy cottages,<br /></span>
<span>Flower gardens, fountains, offices and shops,<br /></span>
<span>All nestle in a dreamy wealth of woods.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Kind hearts received me. All that wealth could bring&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Refinement, luxury and ease&mdash;was theirs;<br /></span>
<span>But I was proud and felt my poverty,<br /></span>
<span>And gladly mured myself among the books<br /></span>
<span>To master 'the lawless science of the law.'<br /></span>
<span>I plodded through the ponderous commentaries&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Some musty with the mildew of old age;<br /></span>
<span>And these I found the better for their years,<br /></span>
<span>Like olden wine in cobweb-covered flasks.<br /></span>
<span>The blush of sunrise found me at my books;<br /></span>
<span>The midnight cock-crow caught me reading still;<br /></span>
<span>And oft my worthy master censured me:<br /></span>
<span>'A time for work,' he said, 'a time for play;<br /></span>
<span>Unbend the bow or else the bow will break.'<br /></span>
<span>But when I wearied&mdash;needing sleep and rest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A single word seemed whispered in my ear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'<i>Beggar</i>,' it stung me to redoubled toil.<br /></span>
<span>I trod the ofttimes mazy labyrinths<br /></span>
<span>Of legal logic&mdash;mined the mountain-mass<br /></span>
<span>Of precedents conflicting&mdash;found the rule,<br /></span>
<span>Then branched into the exceptions; split the hair<br /></span>
<span>Betwixt this case and that&mdash;ran parallels&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Traced from a 'leading case' through many tomes<br /></span>
<span>Back to the first decision on the 'point,'<br /></span>
<span>And often found a pyramid of law<br /></span>
<span>Built with bad logic on a broken base<br /></span>
<span>Of careless '<i>dicta;</i>'&mdash;saw how narrow minds<br /></span>
<span>Spun out the web of technicalities<br /></span>
<span>Till common sense and common equity<br /></span>
<span>Were strangled in its meshes. Here and there<br /></span>
<span>I came upon a broad, unfettered mind<br /></span>
<span>Like Murray's&mdash;cleaving through the spider-webs<br /></span>
<span>Of shallower brains, and bravely pushing out<br /></span>
<span>Upon the open sea of common sense.<br /></span>
<span>But such were rare. The olden precedents&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Oft stepping-stones of tyranny and wrong&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Marked easy paths to follow, and they ruled<br /></span>
<span>The course of reason as the iron rails<br /></span>
<span>Rule the swift wheels of the down-thundering train.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I rose at dawn. First in this holy book<br /></span>
<span>I read my chapter. How the happy thought<br /></span>
<span>That my Pauline would read&mdash;the self-same morn<br /></span>
<span>The self-same chapter&mdash;gave the sacred text,<br /></span>
<span>Though I had heard my mother read it oft,<br /></span>
<span>New light and import never seen before.<br /></span>
<span>For I would ponder over every verse,<br /></span>
<span>Because I felt that she was reading it,<br /></span>
<span>And when I came upon dear promises<br /></span>
<span>Of Christ to man, I read them o'er and o'er,<br /></span>
<span>Till in a holy and mysterious way<br /></span>
<span>They seemed the whisperings of Pauline to me.<br /></span>
<span>Later I learned to lay up for myself<br /></span>
<span>'Treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust<br /></span>
<span>Corrupteth, and where thieves do not break through,<br /></span>
<span>Nor steal'&mdash;and where my treasures all are laid<br /></span>
<span>My heart is, and my spirit longs to go.<br /></span>
<span>O friend, if Jesus was but man of man&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And if indeed his wondrous miracles<br /></span>
<span>Were mythic tales of priestly followers<br /></span>
<span>To chain the brute till Reason came from heaven&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Yet was his mission unto man divine.<br /></span>
<span>Man's pity wounds, but Jesus' pity heals:<br /></span>
<span>He gave us balm beyond all earthly balm;<br /></span>
<span>He gave us strength beyond all human strength;<br /></span>
<span>He taught us love above the low desires;<br /></span>
<span>He taught us hope beyond all earthly hope;<br /></span>
<span>He taught us charity wherewith to build<br /></span>
<span>From out the broken walls of barbarism,<br /></span>
<span>The holy temple of the perfect man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;On every Sabbath-eve I wrote Pauline.<br /></span>
<span>Page after page was burdened with my love,<br /></span>
<span>My glowing hopes of golden days to come,<br /></span>
<span>And frequent boast of rapid progress made.<br /></span>
<span>With hungry heart and eager I devoured<br /></span>
<span>Her letters; I re-read them twenty times.<br /></span>
<span>At morning when I laid the Gospel down<br /></span>
<span>I read her latest answer, and again<br /></span>
<span>At midnight by my lamp I read it over,<br /></span>
<span>And murmuring 'God bless her,' fell asleep<br /></span>
<span>To dream that I was with her under the pines.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Thus fled four years&mdash;four years of patient toil<br /></span>
<span>Sweetened with love and hope, and I had made<br /></span>
<span>Swift progress in my studies. Master said<br /></span>
<span>Another year would bring me to the bar&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>No fledgeling but full-feathered for the field.<br /></span>
<span>And then her letters ceased. I wrote and wrote<br /></span>
<span>Again, but still no answer. Day after day<br /></span>
<span>The tardy mail-coach lagged a mortal hour,<br /></span>
<span>While I sat listening for its welcome horn;<br /></span>
<span>And when it came I hastened from my books<br /></span>
<span>With hope and fear contending in my soul.<br /></span>
<span>Day after day&mdash;no answer&mdash;back again<br /></span>
<span>I turned my footsteps with a weary sigh.<br /></span>
<span>It wore upon me and I could not rest;<br /></span>
<span>It gnawed me to the marrow of my bones.<br /></span>
<span>The heavy tomes grew dull and wearisome,<br /></span>
<span>And sometimes hateful;&mdash;then I broke away<br /></span>
<span>As from a prison and rushed wildly out<br /></span>
<span>Among the elms along the river-bank&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Baring my burning temples to the breeze&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And drank the air of heaven like sparkling wine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Conjuring excuses for her;&mdash;was she ill?<br /></span>
<span>Perhaps forbidden. Had another heart<br /></span>
<span>Come in between us?&mdash;No, that could not be;<br /></span>
<span>She was all constancy and promise-bound.<br /></span>
<span>A month, which seemed to me a laggard year,<br /></span>
<span>Thus wore away. At last a letter came.<br /></span>
<span>O with what springing step I hurried back&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Back to my private chamber and my desk!<br /></span>
<span>With what delight&mdash;what eager, trembling hand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The well-known seal that held my hopes I broke!<br /></span>
<span>Thus ran the letter:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">&quot;'Paul, the time has come<br /></span>
<span>When we must both forgive while we forget.<br /></span>
<span>Mine was a girlish fancy. We outgrow<br /></span>
<span>Such childish follies in our later years.<br /></span>
<span>Now I have pondered well and made an end.<br /></span>
<span>I cannot wed myself to want, and curse<br /></span>
<span>My life life-long, because a girlish freak<br /></span>
<span>Of folly made a promise. So&mdash;farewell.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;My eyes were blind with passion as I read.<br /></span>
<span>I tore the letter into bits and stamped<br /></span>
<span>Upon them, ground my teeth and cursed the day<br /></span>
<span>I met her, to be jilted. All that night<br /></span>
<span>My thoughts ran riot. Round the room I strode<br /></span>
<span>A raving madman&mdash;savage as a Sioux;<br /></span>
<span>Then flung myself upon my couch in tears,<br /></span>
<span>And wept in silence, and then stormed again.<br /></span>
<span>'<i>Beggar!</i>'&mdash;it raised the serpent in my breast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Mad pride&mdash;bat-blind. I seized her pictured face<br /></span>
<span>And ground it under my heel. With impious hand<br /></span>
<span>I caught the book&mdash;the precious gift she gave,<br /></span>
<span>And would have burned it, but that still small voice<br /></span>
<span>Spake in my heart and bade me spare the book.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Then with this Gospel clutched in both my hands,<br /></span>
<span>I swore a solemn oath that I would rise,<br /></span>
<span>If God would spare me;&mdash;she should see me rise,<br /></span>
<span>And learn what she had lost.&mdash;Yes, I would mount<br /></span>
<span>Merely to be revenged. I would not cringe<br /></span>
<span>Down like a spaniel underneath the lash,<br /></span>
<span>But like a man would teach my proud Pauline<br /></span>
<span>And her hard father to repent the day<br /></span>
<span>They called me '<i>beggar</i>.' Thus I raved and stormed<br /></span>
<span>That mad night out;&mdash;forgot at dawn of morn<br /></span>
<span>This holy book, but fell to a huge tome<br /></span>
<span>And read two hundred pages in a day.<br /></span>
<span>I could not keep the thread of argument;<br /></span>
<span>I could not hold my mind upon the book;<br /></span>
<span>I could not break the silent under-tow<br /></span>
<span>That swept all else from out my throbbing brain<br /></span>
<span>But false Pauline. I read from morn till night,<br /></span>
<span>But having closed the book I could not tell<br /></span>
<span>Aught of its contents. Then I cursed myself,<br /></span>
<span>And muttered&mdash;'Fool&mdash;can you not shake it off&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>This nightmare of your boyhood?&mdash;Brave, indeed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Crushed like a spaniel by this false Pauline!<br /></span>
<span>Crushed am I?&mdash;By the gods, I'll make an end,<br /></span>
<span>And she shall never know it nettled me!'<br /></span>
<span>So passed the weary days. My cheeks grew thin;<br /></span>
<span>I needed rest, I said, and quit my books<br /></span>
<span>To range the fields and hills with fowling-piece<br /></span>
<span>And '<i>mal prepense</i>' toward the feathery flocks.<br /></span>
<span>The pigeons flew from tree-tops o'er my head;<br /></span>
<span>I heard the flap of wings&mdash;and they were gone;<br /></span>
<span>The pheasant whizzed from bushes at my feet<br /></span>
<span>Unseen until its sudden whir of wings<br /></span>
<span>Startled and broke my wandering reverie;<br /></span>
<span>And then I whistled and relapsed to dreams,<br /></span>
<span>Wandering I cared not whither&mdash;wheresoe'er<br /></span>
<span>My silent gun still bore its primal charge.<br /></span>
<span>So gameless, but with cheeks and forehead tinged<br /></span>
<span>By breeze and sunshine, I returned to books.<br /></span>
<span>But still a phantom haunted all my dreams&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Awake or sleeping, for awake I dreamed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A spectre that I could not chase away&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The phantom-form of my own false Pauline.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Six months wore off&mdash;six long and weary months;<br /></span>
<span>Then came a letter from a school-boy friend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>In answer to the queries I had made&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Filled with the gossip of my native town.<br /></span>
<span>Unto her father's friend&mdash;a bachelor,<br /></span>
<span>Her senior by full twenty years at least&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Dame Rumor said Pauline had pledged her hand.<br /></span>
<span>I knew him well&mdash;a sly and cunning man&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A honey-tongued, false-hearted flatterer.<br /></span>
<span>And he my rival&mdash;carrying off my prize?<br /></span>
<span>But what cared I? 'twas all the same to me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Yea, better for the sweet revenge to come.<br /></span>
<span>So whispered pride, but in my secret heart<br /></span>
<span>I cared, and hoped whatever came to pass<br /></span>
<span>She might be happy all her days on earth,<br /></span>
<span>And find a happy haven at the end.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;My thoughtful master bade me quit my books<br /></span>
<span>A month at least, for I was wearing out.<br /></span>
<span>'Unbend the bow,' he said. His watchful eye<br /></span>
<span>Saw toil and care at work upon my cheeks;<br /></span>
<span>He could not see the canker at my heart,<br /></span>
<span>But he had seen pale students wear away<br /></span>
<span>With overwork the vigor of their lives;<br /></span>
<span>And so he gave me means and bade me go<br /></span>
<span>To romp a month among my native hills.<br /></span>
<span>I went, but not as I had left my home&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A bashful boy, uncouth and coarsely clad,<br /></span>
<span>But clothed and mannered like a gentleman.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;My school-boy friend gave me a cordial greeting;<br /></span>
<span>That honest lawyer bade me welcome, too,<br /></span>

<span>Since first the iron-horse had coursed the vale<br /></span>
<span>Five years had fled&mdash;five prosperous, magic years,<br /></span>
<span>And well nigh five since I had left my home.<br /></span>
<span>These prosperous years had wrought upon the place<br /></span>
<span>Their wonders till I hardly knew the town.<br /></span>
<span>The broad and stately blocks of brick that shamed<br /></span>
<span>The weather-beaten wooden shops I knew<br /></span>
<span>Seemed the creation of some magic hand.<br /></span>
<span>Adown the river bank the town had stretched,<br /></span>
<span>Sweeping away the quiet grove of pines<br /></span>
<span>Where I had loved to ramble when a boy<br /></span>
<span>And see the squirrels leap from tree to tree<br /></span>
<span>With reckless venture, hazarding a fall<br /></span>
<span>To dodge the ill-aimed arrows from my bow.<br /></span>
<span>The dear old school-house on the hill was gone:<br /></span>
<span>A costly church, tall-spired and built of stone<br /></span>
<span>Stood in its stead&mdash;a monument to man.<br /></span>
<span>Unholy greed had felled the stately pines,<br /></span>
<span>And all the slope was bare and desolate.<br /></span>
<span>Old faces had grown older; some were gone,<br /></span>
<span>And many unfamiliar ones had come.<br /></span>
<span>Boys in their teens had grown to bearded men,<br /></span>
<span>And girls to womanhood, and all was changed,<br /></span>
<span>Save the old cottage-home where I was born.<br /></span>
<span>The elms and butternuts in the meadow-field<br /></span>
<span>Still wore the features of familiar friends;<br /></span>
<span>The English ivy clambered to the roof,<br /></span>
<span>The English willow spread its branches still,<br /></span>
<span>And as I stood before the cottage-door<br /></span>
<span>My heart-pulse quickened, for methought I heard<br /></span>
<span>My mother's footsteps on the ashen floor.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The rumor I had heard was verified;<br /></span>
<span>The wedding-day was named and near at hand.<br /></span>

<span>Glad as a boy that robs the robin's nest<br /></span>
<span>He grasped the hands of half the men he met.<br /></span>
<span>Pauline, I heard, but seldom ventured forth,<br /></span>
<span>Save when her doting father took her out<br /></span>
<span>On Sabbath morns to breathe the balmy air,<br /></span>
<span>And grace with her sweet face his cushioned pew.<br /></span>
<span>The smooth-faced suitor, old dame Gossip said,<br /></span>
<span>Made daily visits to her father's house,<br /></span>
<span>And played the boy at forty years or more,<br /></span>
<span>While she had held him off to draw him on.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I would not fawn upon the hand that smote;<br /></span>
<span>I would not cringe beneath its cruel blow,<br /></span>
<span>Nor even let her know I cared for it.<br /></span>
<span>I kept aloof&mdash;as proud as Lucifer.<br /></span>
<span>But when the church-bells chimed on Sabbath morn<br /></span>
<span>To that proud monument of stone I went&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Her father's pride, since he had led the list<br /></span>
<span>Of wealthy patrons who had builded it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>To hear the sermon&mdash;for methought Pauline<br /></span>
<span>Would hear it too. Might I not see her face,<br /></span>
<span>And she not know I cared to look upon it?<br /></span>
<span>She came not, and the psalms and sermon fell<br /></span>
<span>Upon me like an autumn-mist of rain.<br /></span>
<span>I met her once by chance upon the street&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The day before the appointed wedding-day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Her and her father&mdash;she upon his arm.<br /></span>
<span>'Paul&mdash;O Paul!' she said and gave her hand.<br /></span>
<span>I took it with a cold and careless air&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Begged pardon&mdash;had forgotten;&mdash;'Ah&mdash;Pauline?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Yes, I remembered;&mdash;five long years ago&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And I had made so many later friends,<br /></span>
<span>And she had lost so much of maiden bloom!'<br /></span>
<span>Then turning met her father face to face,<br /></span>
<span>Bowed with cold grace and haughtily passed on.<br /></span>
<span>'This is revenge,' I muttered. Even then<br /></span>
<span>My heart ached as I thought of her pale face,<br /></span>
<span>Her pleading eyes, her trembling, clasping hand!<br /></span>
<span>And then and there I would have turned about<br /></span>
<span>To beg her pardon and an interview,<br /></span>
<span>But pride&mdash;that serpent ever in my heart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Hissed '<i>beggar</i>,' and I cursed her with the lips<br /></span>
<span>That oft had poured my love into her ears.<br /></span>
<span>'She marries gold to-morrow&mdash;let her wed!<br /></span>
<span>She will not wed a beggar, but I think<br /></span>
<span>She'll wed a life-long sorrow&mdash;let her wed!<br /></span>
<span>Aye&mdash;aye&mdash;I hope she'll live to curse the day<br /></span>
<span>Whereon she broke her sacred promises.<br /></span>
<span>And I forgive her?&mdash;yea, but not forget.<br /></span>
<span>I'll take good care that she shall not forget;<br /></span>
<span>I'll prick her memory with a bitter thorn<br /></span>
<span>Through all her future. Let her marry gold!'<br /></span>
<span>Thus ran my muttered words, but in my heart<br /></span>
<span>There ran a counter-current; ere I slept<br /></span>
<span>Its silent under-tow had mastered all&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'Forgive and be forgiven.' I resolved<br /></span>
<span>That on the morning of her wedding-day<br /></span>
<span>Would I go kindly and forgive Pauline,<br /></span>
<span>And send her to the altar with my blessing.<br /></span>
<span>That night I read a chapter in this book&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The first for many months, and fell asleep<br /></span>
<span>Beseeching God to bless her.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Then I dreamed<br /></span>
<span>That we were kneeling at my mother's bed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Her death-bed, and the feeble, trembling hands<br /></span>
<span>Of her who loved us rested on our heads,<br /></span>
<span>And in a voice all tremulous with tears<br /></span>
<span>My mother said: 'Dear children, love each other;<br /></span>
<span>Bear and forbear, and come to me in heaven.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I wakened once&mdash;at midnight&mdash;a wild cry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'<i>Paul, O Paul!</i>' rang through my dreams and broke<br /></span>
<span>My slumber. I arose, but all was still,<br /></span>
<span>And then I, slept again and dreamed till morn.<br /></span>
<span>In all my dreams her dear, sweet face appeared&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Now radiant as a star, and now all pale&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Now glad with smiles and now all wet with tears.<br /></span>
<span>Then came a dream that agonized my soul,<br /></span>
<span>While every limb was bound as if in chains.<br /></span>
<span>Methought I saw her in the silent night<br /></span>
<span>Leaning o'er misty waters dark and deep:<br /></span>
<span>A moan&mdash;a plash of waters&mdash;and, O Christ!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Her agonized face upturned&mdash;imploring hands<br /></span>
<span>Stretched out toward me, and a wailing cry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'<i>Paul, O Paul!</i>' Then face and hands went down,<br /></span>
<span>And o'er her closed the deep and dismal flood<br /></span>
<span>Forever&mdash;but it could not drown the cry:<br /></span>
<span>'<i>Paul, O Paul!</i>' was ringing in my ears;<br /></span>
<span>'<i>Paul, O Paul!</i>' was throbbing in my heart;<br /></span>
<span>And moaning, sobbing in my shuddering soul<br /></span>
<span>Trembled the wail of anguish&mdash;'<i>Paul, O Paul!</i>'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Then o'er the waters stole the silver dawn,<br /></span>
<span>And lo a fairy boat with silken sail!<br /></span>
<span>And in the boat an angel at the helm,<br /></span>
<span>And at her feet the form of her I loved.<br /></span>
<span>The white mists parted as the boat sped on<br /></span>
<span>In silence, lessening far and far away.<br /></span>
<span>And then the sunrise glimmered on the sail<br /></span>
<span>A moment, and the angel turned her face:<br /></span>
<span>My mother!&mdash;and I gave a joyful cry,<br /></span>
<span>And stretched my hands, but lo the hovering mists<br /></span>
<span>Closed in around them and the vision passed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The morning sun stole through the window-blinds<br /></span>
<span>And fell upon my face and wakened me,<br /></span>

<span>The love I bore her all those lonely years;<br /></span>
<span>The hope that held me steadfast to my toil,<br /></span>
<span>And feel the higher and the holier love<br /></span>
<span>Her precious gift had wakened in my soul.<br /></span>
<span>Yea, I would bless her for that precious gift&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>I had not known its treasures but for her,<br /></span>
<span>And O for that would I forgive her all,<br /></span>
<span>And bless the hand that smote me to the soul.<br /></span>
<span>That would be comfort to me all my days,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;A hasty rapping at my chamber-door;<br /></span>

<span>As one with sudden terror dumb, I turned<br /></span>
<span>And in my pillow buried up my face.<br /></span>
<span>Tears came at last, and then my friend passed out<br /></span>
<span>In silence. O the agony of that hour!<br /></span>
<span>O doubts and fears and half-read mysteries<br /></span>
<span>That tore my heart and tortured all my soul!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span>But none could fathom the marvelous mystery.<br /></span>
<span>Bearing a bitter anguish in my heart,<br /></span>
<span>Half-crazed with dread and doubt and boding fears,<br /></span>
<span>Hour after hour alone, disconsolate,<br /></span>
<span>Among the scenes where we had wandered oft<br /></span>
<span>I wandered, sat where once the stately pines<br /></span>
<span>Domed the fair temple where we learned to love.<br /></span>
<span>O spot of sacred memories&mdash;how changed!<br /></span>
<span>Yet chiefly wanting one dear, blushing face<br /></span>
<span>That, in those happy days, made every place<br /></span>
<span>Wherever we might wander&mdash;hill or dale&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Garden of love and peace and happiness.<br /></span>
<span>So heavy-hearted I returned. My friend<br /></span>

<span>I knew the hand upon the envelope&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>With throbbing heart I hastened to my room;<br /></span>

<span>One sheet inclosed another&mdash;one was writ<br /></span>
<span>At midnight by my loved and lost Pauline.<br /></span>
<span>Inclosed within, a letter false and forged,<br /></span>
<span>Signed with my name&mdash;such perfect counterfeit,<br /></span>
<span>At sight I would have sworn it was my own.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Think you my soul was roiled with anger?&mdash;No;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>God's hand was on my head. A keen remorse<br /></span>
<span>Gnawed at my heart. O false and fatal pride<br /></span>
<span>That blinded me, else I had seen the plot<br /></span>
<span>Ere all was lost&mdash;else I had saved a life<br /></span>
<span>To me most precious of all lives on earth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Yea, dearer then than any soul in heaven!<br /></span>
<span>False pride&mdash;the ruin of unnumbered souls&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Thou art the serpent ever tempting me;<br /></span>
<span>God, chastening me, has bruised thy serpent head.<br /></span>
<span>O faithful heart in silence suffering&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>True unto death to one she could but count<br /></span>
<span>A perjured villain, cheated as she was!<br /></span>
<span>Captain, I prayed&mdash;'twas all that I could do.<br /></span>
<span>God heard my prayer, and with a solemn heart,<br /></span>
<span>Bearing the letters in my hand, I went<br /></span>
<span>To ask a favor of the man who crushed<br /></span>
<span>And cursed my life&mdash;to look upon her face&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Only to look on her dear face once more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I rung the bell&mdash;a servant bade me in.<br /></span>
<span>I waited long. At last the father came&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>All pale and suffering. I could see remorse<br /></span>
<span>Was gnawing at his heart; as I arose<br /></span>
<span>He trembled like a culprit on the drop.<br /></span>
<span>'O, sir,' he said, 'whatever be your quest,<br /></span>
<span>I pray you leave me with my dead to-day;<br /></span>
<span>I cannot look on any living face<br /></span>
<span>Till her dead face is gone forevermore.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;'And who hath done this cruel thing?' I said.<br /></span>
<span>'Explain,' he faltered. 'Pray <i>you</i>, sir, explain!'<br /></span>
<span>I said, and thrust the letters in his hand.<br /></span>
<span>And as he sat in silence reading hers,<br /></span>
<span>I saw the pangs of conscience on his face;<br /></span>
<span>I saw him tremble like a stricken soul;<br /></span>
<span>And then a tear-drop fell upon his hand;<br /></span>
<span>And there we sat in silence. Then he groaned<br /></span>
<span>And fell upon his knees and hid his face,<br /></span>
<span>And stretched his hand toward me wailing out&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'I cannot bear this burden on my soul;<br /></span>
<span>O Paul!&mdash;O God!&mdash;forgive me or I die.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;His anguish touched my heart. I took his hand,<br /></span>
<span>And kneeling by him prayed a solemn prayer&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'Father, forgive him, for he knew not what<br /></span>
<span>He did who broke the bond that bound us twain.<br /></span>
<span>O may her spirit whisper in his ear<br /></span>
<span>Forever&mdash;God is love and all is well.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The iron man&mdash;all bowed and broken down&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Sobbed like a child. He laid his trembling hand<br /></span>
<span>With many a fervent blessing on my head,<br /></span>
<span>And, with the crust all crumbled from his heart,<br /></span>
<span>Arose and led me to her silent couch;<br /></span>
<span>And I looked in upon my darling dead.<br /></span>
<span>Mine&mdash;O mine in heaven forevermore!<br /></span>
<span>God's angel sweetly smiling in her sleep;<br /></span>
<span>How beautiful&mdash;how radiant of heaven!<br /></span>
<span>The ring I gave begirt her finger still;<br /></span>
<span>Her golden hair was wreathed with immortelles;<br /></span>
<span>The lips half-parted seemed to move in psalm<br /></span>
<span>Or holy blessing. As I kissed her brow,<br /></span>
<span>It seemed as if her dead cheeks flushed again<br /></span>
<span>As in those happy days beneath the pines;<br /></span>
<span>And as my warm tears fell upon her face,<br /></span>
<span>Methought I heard that dear familiar voice<br /></span>
<span>So full of love and faith and calmest peace,<br /></span>
<span>So near and yet so far and far away,<br /></span>
<span>So mortal, yet so spiritual&mdash;like an air<br /></span>
<span>Of softest music on the slumbering bay<br /></span>
<span>Wafted on midnight wings to silent shores,<br /></span>
<span>When myriad stars are twinkling in the sea:<br /></span>

<span>He slept, but not the silent sleep of death.<br /></span>
<span>I felt his fitful pulse and caught anon<br /></span>
<span>The softly-whispered words &quot;<i>Pauline</i>,&quot; and &quot;<i>Peace</i>.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Anon he clutched with eager, nervous hand,<br /></span>
<span>And in hoarse whisper shouted&mdash;&quot;<i>Steady, men</i>!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Then sunk again. Thus passed an hour or more<br /></span>
<span>And he woke, half-raised himself and said<br /></span>
<span>With feeble voice and eyes strange luster-lit:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Captain, my boat is swiftly sailing out<br /></span>
<span>Into the misty and eternal sea<br /></span>

<span>Is damp and cold upon my hands and face.<br /></span>

<span>A soldier's death amid the gladsome shouts<br /></span>
<span>Of victory for which my puny hands<br /></span>
<span>Did their full share, albeit it was small,<br /></span>
<span>Was all my late ambition. Bring the Flag,<br /></span>
<span>And hold it over my head. Let me die thus<br /></span>
<span>Under the stars I've followed. Dear old Flag&mdash;&quot;<br /></span>

<span>As in the mazes of the Mammoth Cave,<br /></span>
<span>Fainter and fainter on the listening ear,<br /></span>
<span>The low, retreating voices die away.<br /></span>
<span>His eyes were closed; a gentle smile of peace<br /></span>
<span>Sat on his face. I held his nerveless hand,<br /></span>
<span>And bent my ear to catch his latest breath;<br /></span>
<span>And as the spirit fled the pulseless clay,<br /></span>

<span>Faces of their friends departed.<br /></span>
<span>Little moccasins she made him,<br /></span>
<span>Feathered cap and belt of wampum;<br /></span>

<span>Called him K&acirc;k-k&acirc;h-g&egrave;&mdash;the Raven.<br /></span>
<span>Happy hunter was the Panther.<br /></span>
<span>From the woods he brought the pheasant,<br /></span>
<span>Brought the red deer and the rabbit,<br /></span>

<span>Brought the mallard from the marshes&mdash;<br /></span>

<span>Many days, and homeward turning,<br /></span>

<span>&quot;You are cold,&quot; she said, &quot;and famished;<br /></span>

<span>Sat and smoked in sullen silence.<br /></span>
<span>Once&mdash;her dark eyes full of hunger&mdash;<br /></span>

<span>I had rather write one word upon the rock<br /></span>
<span>Of ages than ten thousand in the sand.<br /></span>
<span>The rock of ages! lo I cannot reach<br /></span>
<span>Its lofty shoulders with my puny hand:<br /></span>
<span>I can but touch the sands about its feet.<br /></span>
<span>Yea, I have painted pictures for the blind,<br /></span>
<span>And sung my sweetest songs to ears of stone.<br /></span>
<span>What matter if the dust of ages drift<br /></span>
<span>Five fathoms deep above my grave unknown,<br /></span>
<span>For I have sung and loved the songs I sung.<br /></span>
<span>Who sings for fame the Muses may disown;<br /></span>
<span>Who sings for gold will sing an idle song;<br /></span>
<span>But he who sings because sweet music springs<br /></span>
<span>Unbidden from his heart and warbles long,<br /></span>
<span>May haply touch another heart unknown.<br /></span>
<span>There is sweeter poetry in the hearts of men<br /></span>
<span>Than ever poet wrote or minstrel sung;<br /></span>
<span>For words are clumsy wings for burning thought.<br /></span>
<span>The full heart falters on the stammering tongue,<br /></span>
<span>And silence is more eloquent than song<br /></span>
<span>When tender souls are wrung by grief or shameful wrong.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>The grandest poem is God's Universe:<br /></span>
<span>In measured rhythm the planets whirl their course:<br /></span>
<span>Rhythm swells and throbs in every sun and star,<br /></span>
<span>In mighty ocean's organ-peals and roar,<br /></span>
<span>In billows bounding on the harbor-bar,<br /></span>
<span>In the blue surf that rolls upon the shore,<br /></span>
<span>In the low zephyr's sigh, the tempest's sob,<br /></span>
<span>In the rain's patter and the thunder's roar;<br /></span>
<span>Aye, in the awful earthquake's shuddering throb,<br /></span>
<span>When old Earth cracks her bones and trembles to her core.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>I hear a piper piping on a reed<br /></span>
<span>To listening flocks of sheep and bearded goats;<br /></span>
<span>I hear the larks shrill-warbling o'er the mead<br /></span>
<span>Their silver sonnets from their golden throats;<br /></span>
<span>And in my boyhood's clover-fields I hear<br /></span>
<span>The twittering swallows and the hum of bees.<br /></span>
<span>Ah, sweeter to my heart and to my ear<br /></span>
<span>Than any idyl poet ever sung,<br /></span>
<span>The low, sweet music of their melodies;<br /></span>
<span>Because I listened when my soul was young,<br /></span>
<span>In those dear meadows under maple trees.<br /></span>
<span>My heart they molded when its clay was moist,<br /></span>
<span>And all my life the hum of honey-bees<br /></span>
<span>Hath waked in me a spirit that rejoiced,<br /></span>
<span>And touched the trembling chords of tenderest memories.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>I hear loud voices and a clamorous throng<br /></span>
<span>With braying bugles and with bragging drums&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Bards and bardies laboring at a song.<br /></span>
<span>One lifts his locks, above the rest preferred,<br /></span>
<span>And to the buzzing flies of fashion thrums<br /></span>
<span>A banjo. Lo him follow all the herd.<br /></span>
<span>When Nero's wife put on her auburn wig,<br /></span>
<span>And at the Coliseum showed her head,<br /></span>
<span>The hair of every dame in Rome turned red;<br /></span>
<span>When Nero fiddled all Rome danced a jig.<br /></span>
<span>Novelty sets the gabbling geese agape,<br /></span>
<span>And fickle fashion follows like an ape.<br /></span>
<span>Aye, brass is plenty; gold is scarce and dear;<br /></span>
<span>Crystals abound, but diamonds still are rare.<br /></span>
<span>Is this the golden age, or the age of gold?<br /></span>
<span>Lo by the page or column fame is sold.<br /></span>
<span>Hear the big journal braying like an ass;<br /></span>
<span>Behold the brazen statesmen as they pass;<br /></span>
<span>See dapper poets hurrying for their dimes<br /></span>
<span>With hasty verses hammered out in rhymes:<br /></span>
<span>The Muses whisper&mdash;'&quot;Tis the age of brass.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Workmen are plenty, but the masters few&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Fewer to-day than in the days of old.<br /></span>
<span>Rare blue-eyed pansies peeping pearled with dew,<br /></span>
<span>And lilies lifting up their heads of gold,<br /></span>
<span>Among the gaudy cockscombs I behold,<br /></span>
<span>And here and there a lotus in the shade;<br /></span>
<span>And under English oaks a rose that ne'er will fade.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Fair barks that flutter in the sun your sails,<br /></span>
<span>Piping anon to gay and tented shores<br /></span>
<span>Sweet music and low laughter, it is well<br /></span>
<span>Ye hug the haven when the tempest roars,<br /></span>
<span>For only stalwart ships of oak or steel<br /></span>
<span>May dare the deep and breast the billowy sea<br /></span>
<span>When sweeps the thunder-voiced, dark hurricane,<br /></span>

<span>When in their coffins they lay dumb and stark<br /></span>
<span>Shakespeare began to live, Dante to sing,<br /></span>
<span>And Poe's sweet lute began its werbelling.<br /></span>
<span>Rear monuments of fame or flattery&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Think ye their sleeping souls are made aware?<br /></span>
<span>Heap o'er their heads sweet praise or calumny&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Think ye their moldering ashes hear or care?<br /></span>
<span>Nay, praise and fame are by the living sought;<br /></span>
<span>But he is wise who scorns their flattery,<br /></span>
<span>And who escapes the tongue of calumny<br /></span>
<span>May count himself an angel or a naught:<br /></span>
<span>Lo over Byron's grave a maggot writhes distraught.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Genius is patience, labor and good sense.<br /></span>
<span>Steel and the mind grow bright by frequent use;<br /></span>
<span>In rest they rust. A goodly recompense<br /></span>
<span>Comes from hard toil, but not from its abuse.<br /></span>
<span>The slave, the idler, are alike unblessed;<br /></span>
<span>Aye, in loved labor only is there rest.<br /></span>
<span>But he will read and range and rhyme in vain<br /></span>
<span>Who hath no dust of diamonds in his brain;<br /></span>
<span>And untaught genius is a gem undressed.<br /></span>
<span>The life of man is short, but Art is long,<br /></span>
<span>And labor is the lot of mortal man,<br /></span>
<span>Ordained by God since human time began:<br /></span>
<span>Day follows day and brings its toil and song.<br /></span>
<span>Behind the western mountains sinks the moon,<br /></span>
<span>The silver dawn steals in upon the dark,<br /></span>
<span>Up from the dewy meadow wheels the lark<br /></span>
<span>And trills his welcome to the rising sun,<br /></span>
<span>And lo another day of labor is begun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Poets are born, not made, some scribbler said,<br /></span>

<span>Between the hammer and the anvil. Few<br /></span>
<span>Have the true metal, many have the fire.<br /></span>
<span>No slave or savage ever proved a bard;<br /></span>
<span>Men have their bent, but labor its reward,<br /></span>
<span>And untaught fingers cannot tune the lyre.<br /></span>
<span>The poet's brain with spirit-vision teems;<br /></span>
<span>The voice of nature warbles in his heart;<br /></span>
<span>A sage, a seer, he moves from men apart,<br /></span>
<span>And walks among the shadows of his dreams;<br /></span>
<span>He sees God's light that in all nature beams;<br /></span>
<span>And when he touches with the hand of art<br /></span>
<span>The song of nature welling from his heart,<br /></span>
<span>And guides it forth in pure and limpid streams,<br /></span>
<span>Truth sparkles in the song and like a diamond gleams.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Time and patience change the mulberry-leaf<br /></span>
<span>To shining silk; the lapidary's skill<br /></span>
<span>Makes the rough diamond sparkle at his will,<br /></span>

<span>Better a skillful cobbler at his last<br /></span>
<span>Than unlearned poet twangling on the lyre;<br /></span>
<span>Who sails on land and gallops on the blast,<br /></span>
<span>And mounts the welkin on a braying ass,<br /></span>
<span>Clattering a shattered cymbal bright with brass,<br /></span>
<span>And slips his girth and tumbles in the mire.<br /></span>
<span>All poetry must be, if it be true,<br /></span>
<span>Like the keen arrows of the&mdash;Grecian god<br /></span>
<span>Apollo, that caught fire as they flew.<br /></span>
<span>Ah, such was Byron's, but alas he trod<br /></span>
<span>Ofttimes among the brambles and the rue,<br /></span>
<span>And sometimes dived full deep and brought up mud.<br /></span>
<span>But when he touched with tears, as only he<br /></span>
<span>Could touch, the tender chords of sympathy,<br /></span>
<span>His coldest critics warmed and marveled much,<br /></span>

<span>Truth is the touchstone of all genius Art,<br /></span>

<span>What comes from effort only is but tame.<br /></span>
<span>Nature the only perfect artist is:<br /></span>
<span>Who studies Nature may approach her skill;<br /></span>
<span>Perfection hers, but never can be his,<br /></span>
<span>Though her sweet voice his very marrow thrill;<br /></span>
<span>The finest works of art are Nature's shadows still.<br /></span>

<span>As humming-bird the lily's nectar sips,<br /></span>

<span>They bound a bandage o'er his eyes,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The brave knight pinioned there.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">They freed his feet and hands.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;I give thee my castle,&quot; Maria cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&quot;And I give thee my heart and hand,<br /></span>
<span>And Maria will be the proudest bride<br /></span>

<span class="i2">My castle for a ring.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>The red blood flushed to the brave knight's face<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As he looked on the lady fair;<br /></span>
<span>He sprang to her arms in a fond embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he married her then and there.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>So the little blind elf with his feathered shaft<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Did more than the sword could do,<br /></span>

<span>Where the foaming tide tumbles and whirls o'er the murmuring rocks in the rapids;<br /></span>

<h4>THE FOOT RACES.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>On an arm of an oak hangs the prize for the swiftest and strongest of runners&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A blanket as red as the skies, when the flames sweep the plains in October.<br /></span>
<span>And beside it a strong, polished bow, and a quiver of iron-tipped arrows,<br /></span>
<span>Which <i>Kap&oacute;za's</i> tall chief will bestow on the fleet-footed second that follows.<br /></span>
<span>A score of swift runners are there from the several bands of the nation,<br /></span>
<span>And now for the race they prepare, and among them fleet-footed Tamd&oacute;ka.<br /></span>
<span>With the oil of the buck and the bear their sinewy limbs are annointed,<br /></span>
<span>For fleet are the feet of the deer and strong are the limbs of the bruin.<br /></span>

<span>From his <i>teepee</i> the tall chieftain comes, and DuLuth brings a prize for the runners&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A keen hunting-knife from the Seine, horn-handled and mounted with silver.<br /></span>
<span>The runners are ranged on the plain, and the Chief waves a flag as a signal,<br /></span>
<span>And away like the gray wolves they fly&mdash;like the wolves on the trail of the red-deer;<br /></span>
<span>O'er the hills and the prairie they vie, and strain their strong limbs to the utmost,<br /></span>
<span>While high on the hills hangs a cloud of warriors and maidens and mothers,<br /></span>
<span>To see the swift-runners, and loud are the cheers and the shouts of the warriors.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Now swift from the lake they return o'er the emerald hills of the prairies;<br /></span>
<span>Like grey-hounds they pant and they yearn, and the leader of all is Tamd&oacute;ka.<br /></span>

<span>A warrior with eagle-winged feet, but his prize is the bow and the quiver.<br /></span>
<span>Tamd&oacute;ka first reaches the post, and his are the knife and the blanket,<br /></span>
<span>By the mighty acclaim of the host and award of the chief and the judges.<br /></span>
<span>Then proud was the tall warrior's stride, and haughty his look and demeanor;<br /></span>
<span>He boasted aloud in his pride, and he scoffed at the rest of the runners.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Behold me, for I am a man!<a name='FNanchor_AB'></a><a href='#Footnote_AB'><sup>[AB]</sup></a> my feet are as swift as the West-wind.<br /></span>

<span>Come!&mdash;where is the hunter will dare match his feet with the feet of Tamd&oacute;ka?<br /></span>
<span>Let him think of <i>Tat&eacute;</i><a name='FNanchor_AC'></a><a href='#Footnote_AC'><sup>[AC]</sup></a> and beware, ere he stake his last robe on the trial.&quot;<br /></span>

<span>Then forth from the side of the chief stepped DuLuth and he looked on the boaster;<br /></span>

<span>&quot;But the feet of Tamd&oacute;ka are tired; abide till the cool of the sunset.&quot;<br /></span>

<span>Now afar o'er the plains of the west walked the sun at the end of his journey,<br /></span>

<span>Like a forest of larches the hordes were gathered to witness the contest;<br /></span>
<span>As loud as the drums were their words and they roared like the roar of the <i>Ha-ha.</i><br /></span>
<span>For some for Tamd&oacute;ka contend, and some for the fair, bearded stranger,<br /></span>
<span>And the betting runs high to the end, with the skins of the bison and beaver.<br /></span>
<span>A wife of tall <i>W&aacute;z&iacute;-kut&eacute;</i>&mdash;the mother of boastful Tamd&oacute;ka&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Brought her handsomest robe from the <i>tee</i> with a vaunting and loud proclamation:<br /></span>
<span>She would stake her last robe on her son who, she boasted, was fleet as the <i>cabri</i>,<br /></span>
<span>And the tall, tawny chieftain looked on, approving the boast of the mother.<br /></span>
<span>Then fleet as the feet of a fawn to her lodge ran the dark-eyed Winona,<br /></span>
<span>She brought and she spread on the lawn, by the side of the robe of the boaster,<br /></span>
<span>The lily-red mantel DuLuth, with his own hands, had laid on her shoulders.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Tamd&oacute;ka is swift, but forsooth, the tongue of his mother is swifter,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>She said, and her face was aflame with the red of the rose and the lily,<br /></span>

<span>They strip for the race and prepare,&mdash;DuLuth in his breeches and leggins;<br /></span>
<span>And the brown, curling locks of his hair down droop to his bare, brawny shoulders,<br /></span>
<span>And his face wears a smile debonair, as he tightens his red sash around him;<br /></span>
<span>But stripped to the moccasins bare, save the belt and the breech-clout of buckskin,<br /></span>
<span>Stands the haughty Tamd&oacute;ka aware that the eyes of the warriors admire him;<br /></span>
<span>For his arms are the arms of a bear and his legs are the legs of a panther.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>The drum beats,&mdash;the chief waves the flag, and away on the course speed the runners,<br /></span>
<span>And away leads the brave like a stag,&mdash;like a bound on his track flies the Frenchman;<br /></span>
<span>And away haste the hunters once more to the hills, for a view to the lakeside,<br /></span>
<span>And the dark-swarming hill-tops, they roar with the storm of loud voices commingled.<br /></span>
<span>Far away o'er the prairie they fly, and still in the lead is Tamd&oacute;ka,<br /></span>
<span>But the feet of his rival are nigh, and slowly he gains on the hunter.<br /></span>
<span>Now they turn on the post at the lake,&mdash;now they run full abreast on the home-stretch:<br /></span>
<span>Side by side they contend for the stake for a long mile or more on the prairie<br /></span>
<span>They strain like a stag and a hound, when the swift river gleams through the thicket,<br /></span>
<span>And the horns of the riders resound, winding shrill through the depths of the forest.<br /></span>
<span>But behold!&mdash;at full length on the ground falls the fleet-footed Frenchman abruptly,<br /></span>
<span>And away with a whoop and a bound springs the eager, exulting Tamd&oacute;ka<br /></span>
<span>Long and loud on the hills is the shout of his swarthy admirers and backers,<br /></span>
<span>&quot;But the race is not won till it's out,&quot; said DuLuth, to himself as he gathered,<br /></span>
<span>With a frown on his face, for the foot of the wily Tamd&oacute;ka had tripped him.<br /></span>
<span>Far ahead ran the brave on the route, and turning he boasted exultant.<br /></span>
<span>Like spurs to the steed to DuLuth were the jeers and the taunts of the boaster;<br /></span>
<span>Indignant was he and red wroth at the trick of the runner dishonest;<br /></span>
<span>And away like a whirlwind he speeds&mdash;like a hurricane mad from the mountains;<br /></span>
<span>He gains on Tamd&oacute;ka,&mdash;he leads!&mdash;and behold, with the spring of a panther,<br /></span>
<span>He leaps to the goal and succeeds, 'mid the roar of the mad acclamation.<br /></span>
<span>Then glad as the robin in May was the voice of Winona exulting;<br /></span>
<span>Tamd&oacute;ka turned sullen away, and sulking he walked by the river;<br /></span>
<span>He glowered as he went and the fire of revenge in his bosom was kindled:<br /></span>
<span>Dark was his visage with ire and his eyes were the eyes of a panther.<br /></span>

<h4>WINONA'S WARNING.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Twas sunrise; the spirits of mist trailed their white robes on dewy savannas,<br /></span>
<span>And the flowers raised their heads to be kissed by the first golden beams of the morning.<br /></span>
<span>The breeze was abroad with the breath of the rose of the Isles of the Summer,<br /></span>
<span>And the humming-bird hummed on the heath from his home in the land of the rainbow.<a name='FNanchor_AI'></a><a href='#Footnote_AI'><sup>[AI]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span>'Twas the morn of departure. DuLuth stood alone by the roar of the <i>Ha-ha</i>;<br /></span>
<span>Tall and fair in the strength of his youth stood the blue-eyed and fair-bearded Frenchman.<br /></span>
<span>A rustle of robes on the grass broke his dream as he mused by the waters,<br /></span>
<span>And, turning, he looked on the face of Winona, wild-rose of the prairies,<br /></span>
<span>Half hid in her dark, flowing hair, like the round, golden moon in the pine-tops.<br /></span>
<span>Admiring he gazed&mdash;she was fair as his own blooming Flore in her orchards,<br /></span>
<span>With her golden locks loose on the air, like the gleam of the sun through the olives,<br /></span>
<span>Far away on the vine-covered shore, in the sun-favored land of his fathers.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Lists the chief to the cataract's roar for the mournful lament of the Spirit?&quot;<a name='FNanchor_AJ'></a><a href='#Footnote_AJ'><sup>[AJ]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span>Said Winona,&mdash;&quot;The wail of the sprite for her babe and its father unfaithful,<br /></span>
<span>Is heard in the midst of the night, when the moon wanders dim in the heavens.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Wild-Rose of the Prairies,&quot; he said, &quot;DuLuth listens not to the <i>Ha-ha</i>,<br /></span>
<span>For the wail of the ghost of the dead for her babe and its father unfaithful;<br /></span>
<span>But he lists to a voice in his heart that is heard by the ear of no other,<br /></span>
<span>And to-day will the White Chief depart; he returns to the land of the sunrise.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Let Winona depart with the chief,&mdash;she will kindle the fire in his <i>teepee</i>;<br /></span>
<span>For long are the days of her grief, if she stay in the <i>tee</i> of Ta-t&eacute;-psin,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>She replied, and her cheeks were aflame with the bloom of the wild prairie lilies.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;<i>Tanke</i><a name='FNanchor_AK'></a><a href='#Footnote_AK'><sup>[AK]</sup></a>, is the White Chief to blame?&quot; said DuLuth to the blushing Winona.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;The White Chief is blameless,&quot; she said, &quot;but the heart of Winona will follow<br /></span>
<span>Wherever thy footsteps may lead, O blue-eyed, brave Chief of the white men.<br /></span>
<span>For her mother sleeps long in the mound, and a step-mother rules in the <i>teepee</i>,<br /></span>
<span>And her father, once strong and renowned, is bent with the weight of his winters.<br /></span>
<span>No longer he handles the spear,&mdash;no longer his swift, humming arrows<br /></span>
<span>Overtake the fleet feet of the deer, or the bear of the woods, or the bison;<br /></span>
<span>But he bends as he walks, and the wind shakes his white hair and hinders his footsteps;<br /></span>
<span>And soon will he leave me behind, without brother or sister or kindred.<br /></span>
<span>The doe scents the wolf in the wind, and a wolf walks the path of Winona.<br /></span>
<span>Three times have the gifts for the bride<a name='FNanchor_55'></a><a href='#Footnote_55'><sup>[55]</sup></a> to the lodge of Ta-t&eacute;-psin been carried,<br /></span>
<span>But the voice of Winona replied that she liked not the haughty Tamd&oacute;ka.<br /></span>
<span>And thrice were the gifts sent away, but the tongue of the mother protested,<br /></span>
<span>And the were-wolf<a name='FNanchor_52'></a><a href='#Footnote_52'><sup>[52]</sup></a> still follows his prey, and abides but the death of my father.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<span>But soon I return to the land, and a cloud of my hunters will follow.<br /></span>

<span>Many moons will his hunters remain in the land of the friendly Dakotas.<br /></span>
<span>The son of Chief W&aacute;z&iacute;-Kut&eacute; guides the White Chief afar on his journey;<br /></span>
<span>Nor long on the <i>T&acirc;nka Med&eacute;</i><a name='FNanchor_AM'></a><a href='#Footnote_AM'><sup>[AM]</sup></a>&mdash;on the breast of the blue, bounding billows&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Shall the bark of the Frenchman delay, but his pathway shall kindle behind him.&quot;<br /></span>

<span>She was pale, and her hurried voice swelled with alarm as she questioned replying&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Tamd&oacute;ka thy guide?&mdash;I beheld thy death in his face at the races.<br /></span>
<span>He covers his heart with a smile, but revenge never sleeps in his bosom;<br /></span>
<span>His tongue&mdash;it is soft to beguile; but beware of the pur of the panther!<br /></span>
<span>For death, like a shadow, will walk by thy side in the midst of the forest,<br /></span>
<span>Or follow thy path like a hawk on the trail of a wounded <i>Mast&iacute;nca</i>.<a name='FNanchor_AN'></a><a href='#Footnote_AN'><sup>[AN]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span>A son of <i>Unkt&eacute;hee</i> is he,&mdash;the Chief of the crafty magicians;<br /></span>

<span>And strong is the arm of my youth, and stout are the hearts of my warriors;<br /></span>

<span>&quot;<i>Niw&aacute;st&egrave;</i>,&quot;<a name='FNanchor_AQ'></a><a href='#Footnote_AQ'><sup>[AQ]</sup></a> she sadly replied; in her low voice the rising tears trembled;<br /></span>

<h4>DULUTH'S DEPARTURE</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>To bid the brave White Chief adieu, on the shady shore gathered the warriors;<br /></span>
<span>His glad boatmen manned the canoe, and the oars in their hands were impatient.<br /></span>
<span>Spake the Chief of <i>Is&aacute;ntees</i>: &quot;A feast will await the return of my brother.<br /></span>
<span>In peace rose the sun in the East, in peace in the West he descended.<br /></span>
<span>May the feet of my brother be swift till they bring him again to our <i>teepees</i>,<br /></span>
<span>The red pipe he takes as a gift, may he smoke that red pipe many winters.<br /></span>
<span>At my lodge-fire his pipe shall be lit, when the White Chief returns to <i>Kath&aacute;ga</i>;<br /></span>
<span>On the robes of my <i>tee</i> shall he sit; he shall smoke with the chiefs of my people.<br /></span>
<span>The brave love the brave, and his son sends the Chief as a guide for his brother,<br /></span>
<span>By the way of the <i>W&aacute;kpa Wak&aacute;n</i><a name='FNanchor_AR'></a><a href='#Footnote_AR'><sup>[AR]</sup></a> to the Chief at the Lake of the Spirits.<br /></span>
<span>As light as the foot-steps of dawn are the feet of the stealthy Tamd&oacute;ka;<br /></span>
<span>He fears not the <i>M&aacute;za Wak&aacute;n</i>;<a name='FNanchor_AS'></a><a href='#Footnote_AS'><sup>[AS]</sup></a> he is sly as the fox of the forest.<br /></span>
<span>When he dances the dance of red war howl the wolves by the broad <i>Mini-ya-ta</i>,<a name='FNanchor_AT'></a><a href='#Footnote_AT'><sup>[AT]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span>For they scent on the south-wind afar their feast on the bones of Ojibways.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Thrice the Chief puffed the red pipe of peace, ere it passed to the lips of the Frenchman.<br /></span>
<span>Spake DuLuth: &quot;May the Great Spirit bless with abundance the Chief and his people;<br /></span>
<span>May their sons and their daughters increase, and the fire ever burn in their <i>teepees</i>.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Then he waved with a flag his adieu to the Chief and the warriors assembled;<br /></span>
<span>And away shot Tamd&oacute;ka's canoe to the strokes of ten sinewy hunters;<br /></span>
<span>And a white path he clove up the blue, bubbling stream of the swift Mississippi;<br /></span>
<span>And away on his foaming trail flew, like a sea-gull, the bark of the Frenchman.<br /></span>

<h4>THE CANOE RACE.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Now a light rustling wind from the South shakes his wings o'er the wide, wimpling waters:<br /></span>
<span>Up the dark-winding river DuLuth follows fast in the wake of Tamd&oacute;ka.<br /></span>
<span>On the slopes of the emerald shores leafy woodlands and prairies alternate;<br /></span>
<span>On the vine-tangled islands the flowers peep timidly out at the white men;<br /></span>
<span>In the dark-winding eddy the loon sits warily watching and voiceless,<br /></span>
<span>And the wild-goose, in reedy lagoon, stills the prattle and play of her children.<br /></span>
<span>The does and their sleek, dappled fawns prick their ears and peer out from the thickets,<br /></span>
<span>And the bison-calves play on the lawns, and gambol like colts in the clover.<br /></span>
<span>Up the still-flowing <i>W&aacute;kpa Wak&aacute;n's</i> winding path through the groves and the meadows,<br /></span>
<span>Now DuLuth's brawny boatmen pursue the swift-gliding bark of Tamd&oacute;ka;<br /></span>
<span>And hardly the red braves out-do the stout, steady oars of the white men.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Now they bend to their oars in the race&mdash;the ten tawny braves of Tamd&oacute;ka;<br /></span>
<span>And hard on their heels in the chase ply the six stalwart oars of the Frenchmen.<br /></span>
<span>In the stern of his boat sits DuLuth; in the stern of his boat sits Tamd&oacute;ka,<br /></span>
<span>And warily, cheerily, both urge the oars of their men to the utmost.<br /></span>
<span>Far-stretching away to the eyes, winding blue in the midst of the meadows,<br /></span>
<span>As a necklet of sapphires that lies unclaspt in the lap of a virgin,<br /></span>
<span>Here asleep in the lap of the plain lies the reed-bordered, beautiful river.<br /></span>
<span>Like two flying coursers that strain, on the track, neck and neck on the home-stretch,<br /></span>
<span>With nostrils distended and mane froth-flecked, and the neck and the shoulders,<br /></span>
<span>Each urged to his best by the cry and the whip and the rein of his rider,<br /></span>
<span>Now they skim o'er the waters and fly, side by side, neck and neck, through the meadows,<br /></span>
<span>The blue heron flaps from the reeds, and away wings her course up the river:<br /></span>
<span>Straight and swift is her flight o'er the meads, but she hardly outstrips the canoemen.<br /></span>
<span>See! the <i>voyageurs</i> bend to their oars till the blue veins swell out on their foreheads;<br /></span>
<span>And the sweat from their brawny breasts pours; but in vain their Herculean labor;<br /></span>
<span>For the oars of Tamd&oacute;ka are ten, and but six are the oars of the Frenchman,<br /></span>
<span>And the red warriors' burden of men is matched by the <i>voyageurs'</i> luggage.<br /></span>
<span>Side by side, neck and neck, for a mile, still they strain their strong arms to the utmost,<br /></span>
<span>Till rounding a willowy isle, now ahead creeps the boat of Tamd&oacute;ka,<br /></span>
<span>And the neighboring forests profound, and the far-stretching plain of the meadows<br /></span>
<span>To the whoop of the victors resound, while the panting French rest on their paddles.<br /></span>

<h4>IN CAMP.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>With sable wings wide o'er the land night sprinkles the dew of the heavens;<br /></span>
<span>And hard by the dark river's strand, in the midst of a tall, somber forest,<br /></span>
<span>Two camp fires are lighted and beam on the trunks and the arms of the pine trees.<br /></span>
<span>In the fitful light darkle and gleam the swarthy-hued faces around them.<br /></span>
<span>And one is the camp of DuLuth, and the other the camp of Tamd&oacute;ka.<br /></span>
<span>But few are the jests and uncouth of the voyageurs over their supper,<br /></span>
<span>While moody and silent the braves round their fire in a circle sit crouching;<br /></span>
<span>And low is the whisper of leaves and the sough of the wind in the branches;<br /></span>
<span>And low is the long-winding howl of the lone wolf afar in the forest;<br /></span>
<span>But shrill is the hoot of the owl, like a bugle-blast blown in the pine-tops,<br /></span>
<span>And the half-startled <i>voyageurs</i> scowl at the sudden and saucy intruder.<br /></span>
<span>Like the eyes of the wolves are the eyes of the watchful and silent Dakotas;<br /></span>
<span>Like the face of the moon in the skies, when the clouds chase each other across it,<br /></span>
<span>Is Tamd&oacute;ka's dark face in the light of the flickering flames of the camp-fire.<br /></span>
<span>They have plotted red murder by night, and securely contemplate their victims.<br /></span>
<span>But wary and armed to the teeth are the resolute Frenchmen, and ready,<br /></span>
<span>If need be, to grapple with death, and to die hand to hand in the forest.<br /></span>
<span>Yet skilled in the arts and the wiles of the cunning and crafty <i>Algonkins</i><a name='FNanchor_AW'></a><a href='#Footnote_AW'><sup>[AW]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span>They cover their hearts with their smiles, and hide their suspicions of evil.<br /></span>
<span>Round their low, smouldering fire, feigning sleep, lie the watchful and wily Dakotas;<br /></span>
<span>But DuLuth and his <i>voyageurs</i> heap their fire that shall blaze till the morning,<br /></span>
<span>Ere they lay themselves snugly to rest, with their guns by their sides on the blankets,<br /></span>
<span>As if there were none to molest but the gray, skulking wolves of the forest.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Tis midnight. The rising moon gleams, weird and still, o'er the dusky horizon;<br /></span>
<span>Through the hushed, somber forest she beams, and fitfully gloams on the meadows;<br /></span>
<span>And a dim, glimmering pathway she paves, at times, on the dark stretch of river.<br /></span>
<span>The winds are asleep in the caves&mdash;in the heart of the far-away mountains;<br /></span>
<span>And here on the meadows and there, the lazy mists gather and hover;<br /></span>
<span>And the lights of the Fen-Spirits<a name='FNanchor_72'></a><a href='#Footnote_72'><sup>[72]</sup></a> flare and dance on the low-lying marshes,<br /></span>
<span>As still as the footsteps of death by the bed of the babe and its mother;<br /></span>
<span>And hushed are the pines, and beneath lie the weary-limbed boatmen in slumber.<br /></span>
<span>Walk softly,&mdash;walk softly, O Moon, through the gray, broken clouds in thy pathway,<br /></span>
<span>For the earth lies asleep and the boon of repose is bestowed on the weary.<br /></span>
<span>Toiling hands have forgotten their care; e'en the brooks have forgotten to murmur;<br /></span>
<span>But hark!&mdash;there's a sound on the air!&mdash;'tis the light-rustling robes of the Spirits,<br /></span>
<span>Like the breath of the night in the leaves, or the murmur of reeds on the river,<br /></span>
<span>In the cool of the mid-summer eyes, when the blaze of the day has descended.<br /></span>
<span>Low-crouching and shadowy forms, as still as the gray morning's footsteps,<br /></span>
<span>Creep sly as the serpent that charms, on her nest in the meadow, the plover;<br /></span>
<span>In the shadows of pine-trunks they creep, but their panther-eyes gleam in the fire-light,<br /></span>
<span>As they peer on the white-men asleep, in the glow of the fire, on their blankets.<br /></span>
<span>Lo in each swarthy right-hand a knife; in the left-hand, the bow and the arrows!<br /></span>
<span>Brave Frenchmen, awake to the strife!&mdash;or you sleep in the forest forever.<br /></span>
<span>Nay, nearer and nearer they glide, like ghosts on the field of their battles,<br /></span>
<span>Till close on the sleepers, they bide but the signal of death from Tamd&oacute;ka.<br /></span>
<span>Still the sleepers sleep on. Not a breath stirs the leaves of the awe-stricken forest;<br /></span>
<span>The hushed air is heavy with death; like the footsteps of death are the moments.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;<i>Arise!</i>&quot;&mdash;At the word, with a bound, to their feet spring the vigilant Frenchmen;<br /></span>
<span>And the depths of the forest resound to the crack and the roar of their rifles;<br /></span>
<span>And seven writhing forms on the ground clutch the earth. From the pine-tops the screech-owl<br /></span>
<span>Screams and flaps his wide wings in affright, and plunges away through the shadows;<br /></span>
<span>And swift on the wings of the night flee the dim, phantom-forms through the darkness.<br /></span>
<span>Like <i>cabris</i><a name='FNanchor_80'></a><a href='#Footnote_80'><sup>[80]</sup></a> when white wolves pursue, fled the four yet remaining Dakotas;<br /></span>
<span>Through forest and fen-land they flew, and wild terror howled on their footsteps.<br /></span>
<span>And one was Tamd&oacute;ka. DuLuth through the night sent his voice like a trumpet:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Ye are <i>Sons of Unkt&eacute;hee</i>, forsooth! Return to your mothers, ye cowards!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>His shrill voice they heard as they fled, but only the echoes made answer.<br /></span>
<span>At the feet of the brave Frenchmen, dead, lay seven swarthy <i>Sons of whitehead</i>;<br /></span>
<span>And there, in the midst of the slain, they found, as it gleamed in the fire-light,<br /></span>
<span>The horn-handled knife from the Seine, where it fell from the hand of Tamd&oacute;ka.<br /></span>

<span>In the gray of the morn, ere the sun peeped over the dewy horizon,<br /></span>

<span>But dauntless they reached it at last, and found Akee-p&aacute;-kee-tin's<a name='FNanchor_AY'></a><a href='#Footnote_AY'><sup>[AY]</sup></a> village,<br /></span>
<span>On an isle in the midst of the lake; and a day in his teepees they tarried.<br /></span>
<span>Of the deed in the wilderness spake, to the brave Chief, the frank-hearted Frenchman.<br /></span>
<span>A generous man was the Chief, and a friend of the fearless explorer;<br /></span>
<span>And dark was his visage with grief at the treacherous act of the warriors.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Brave W&aacute;z&iacute;-kut&eacute; is a man, and his heart is as clear as the sunlight;<br /></span>
<span>But the head of a treacherous clan and a snake-in-the-grass, is Tamd&oacute;ka,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Said the chief; and he promised DuLuth, on the word of a friend and a warrior,<br /></span>
<span>To carry the pipe and the truth to his cousin, the chief at Kath&aacute;ga;<br /></span>
<span>For thrice at the <i>T&acirc;nka Med&eacute;</i> he smoked in the lodge of the Frenchman;<br /></span>
<span>And thrice had he carried away the bountiful gifts of the trader.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>When the chief could no longer prevail on the white men to rest in his <i>teepees</i>,<br /></span>

<span>And behold, at the foot of the hill, a cluster of Chippewa wigwams,<br /></span>
<span>And the busy wives plying with skill their nets in the emerald waters.<br /></span>
<span>Two hundred white winters and more have fled from the face of the Summer<br /></span>
<span>Since DuLuth on that wild, somber shore, in the unbroken forest primeval,<br /></span>
<span>From the midst of the spruce and the pines, saw the smoke of the wigwams up-curling,<br /></span>
<span>Like the fumes from the temples and shrines of the Druids of old in their forests.<br /></span>
<span>Ah, little he dreamed then, forsooth, that a city would stand on that hill-side,<br /></span>
<span>And bear the proud name of DuLuth, the untiring and dauntless explorer,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A refuge for ships from the storms, and for men from the bee-hives of Europe,<br /></span>

<h4>WINONA AND TA-TE-PSIN.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>'Tis the moon of the sere, falling leaves. From the heads of the maples the west-wind<br /></span>
<span>Plucks the red-and-gold plumage and grieves on the meads for the rose and the lily;<br /></span>
<span>Their brown leaves the moaning oaks strew, and the breezes that roam on the prairies,<br /></span>
<span>Low-whistling and wanton pursue the down of the silk-weed and thistle.<br /></span>
<span>All sere are the prairies and brown in the glimmer and haze of the Autumn;<br /></span>
<span>From the far northern marshes flock down, by thousands, the geese and the mallards.<br /></span>
<span>From the meadows and wide-prairied plains, for their long southward journey preparing.<br /></span>
<span>In croaking flocks gather the cranes, and choose with loud clamor their leaders.<br /></span>
<span>The breath of the evening is cold, and lurid along the horizon<br /></span>
<span>The flames of the prairies are rolled, on the somber skies flashing their torches.<br /></span>
<span>At noontide a shimmer of gold through the haze pours the sun from his pathway.<br /></span>
<span>The wild-rice is gathered and ripe, on the moors, lie the scarlet <i>po-pan-ka</i>,<a name='FNanchor_BF'></a><a href='#Footnote_BF'><sup>[BF]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span><i>Mich&aacute;bo</i><a name='FNanchor_85'></a><a href='#Footnote_85'><sup>[85]</sup></a> is smoking his pipe,&mdash;'tis the soft, dreamy Indian Summer,<br /></span>

<span>For a time turns his beautiful eyes, and backward looks over his shoulder.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>It is noon. From his path in the skies the red sun looks down on <i>Kath&aacute;ga</i>.<br /></span>
<span>Asleep in the valley it lies, for the swift hunters follow the bison.<br /></span>
<span>Ta-t&eacute;-psin, the aged brave, bends as he walks by the side of Winona;<br /></span>
<span>Her arm to his left hand she lends, and he feels with his staff for the pathway;<br /></span>
<span>On his slow, feeble footsteps attends his gray dog, the watchful Wich&aacute;ka; <a name='FNanchor_BG'></a><a href='#Footnote_BG'><sup>[BG]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span>For blind in his years is the chief of a fever that followed the Summer,<br /></span>
<span>And the days of Ta-t&eacute;-psin are brief. Once more by the dark-rolling river<br /></span>
<span>Sits the Chief in the warm, dreamy haze of the beautiful Summer in Autumn;<br /></span>
<span>And the faithful dog lovingly lays his head at the feet of his master.<br /></span>
<span>On a dead, withered branch sits a crow, down-peering askance at the old man;<br /></span>
<span>On the marge of the river below romp the nut-brown and merry-voiced children,<br /></span>
<span>And the dark waters silently flow, broad and deep, to the plunge of the Ha-ha.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>By his side sat Winona. He laid his thin, shriveled hand on her tresses,<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Winona my daughter,&quot; he said, &quot;no longer thy father beholds thee;<br /></span>

<span>When Sis&oacute;ka <a name='FNanchor_BH'></a><a href='#Footnote_BH'><sup>[BH]</sup></a> sat faithful and fair in the lodge of swift footed Ta-t&eacute;-psin.<br /></span>
<span>The white years have broken my spear; from my bow they have taken the bow-string;<br /></span>
<span>But once on the trail of the deer, like a gray wolf from sunrise till sunset,<br /></span>
<span>By woodland and meadow and mere, ran the feet of Ta-t&eacute;-psin untiring.<br /></span>
<span>But dim are the days that are gone, and darkly around me they wander,<br /></span>
<span>Like the pale, misty face of the moon when she walks through the storm of the winter;<br /></span>
<span>And sadly they speak in my ear. I have looked on the graves of my kindred.<br /></span>
<span>The Land of the Spirits is near. Death walks by my side like a shadow.<br /></span>
<span>Now open thine ear to my voice, and thy heart to the wish of thy father,<br /></span>
<span>And long will Winona rejoice that she heeded the words of Ta-t&eacute;-psin.<br /></span>
<span>The cold, cruel winter is near, and famine will sit in the teepee.<br /></span>
<span>What hunter will bring me the deer, or the flesh of the bear or the bison?<br /></span>
<span>For my kinsmen before me have gone; they hunt in the land of the shadows.<br /></span>
<span>In my old age forsaken, alone, must I die in my teepee of hunger?<br /></span>
<span>Winona, Tamd&oacute;ka can make my empty lodge laugh with abundance;<br /></span>
<span>For thine aged and blind father's sake, to the son of the Chief speak the promise.<br /></span>
<span>For gladly again to my tee will the bridal gifts come for my daughter.<br /></span>
<span>A fleet-footed hunter is he, and the good spirits feather his arrows;<br /></span>
<span>And the cold, cruel winter will be a feast-time instead of a famine.&quot;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;My father,&quot; she said, and her voice was filial and full of compassion,<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Would the heart of Ta-t&eacute;-psin rejoice at the death of Winona, his daughter?<br /></span>
<span>The crafty Tamd&oacute;ka I hate. Must I die in his <i>teepee</i> of sorrow?<br /></span>
<span>For I love the White Chief and I wait his return to the land of Dakotas.<br /></span>
<span>When the cold winds of winter return, and toss the white robes of the prairies,<br /></span>
<span>The fire of the White Chief will burn in his lodge at the Meeting-of-Waters.<br /></span>
<span>Winona's heart followed his feet far away to the land of the Morning,<br /></span>
<span>And she hears in her slumber his sweet, kindly voice call the name of thy daughter.<br /></span>
<span>My father, abide, I entreat, the return of the brave to <i>Kat&aacute;hga</i>.<br /></span>
<span>The wild-rice is gathered, the meat of the bison is stored in the <i>teepee</i>;<br /></span>
<span>Till the Coon-Moon<a name='FNanchor_71'></a><a href='#Footnote_71'><sup>[71]</sup></a> enough and to spare; and if then the white warrior return not,<br /></span>
<span>Winona will follow the bear and the coon to their dens in the forest.<br /></span>
<span>She is strong; she can handle the spear; she can bend the stout bow of the hunter;<br /></span>
<span>And swift on the trail of the deer will she run o'er the snow on her snow-shoes.<br /></span>
<span>Let the step-mother sit in the tee, and kindle the fire for my father;<br /></span>
<span>And the cold, cruel winter shall be a feast-time instead of a famine.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;The White Chief will never return,&quot; half angrily muttered Ta-t&eacute;-psin;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;His camp-fire will nevermore burn in the land of the warriors he slaughtered.<br /></span>
<span>I grieve, for my daughter has said that she loves the false friend of her kindred;<br /></span>
<span>For the hands of the White Chief are red with the blood of the trustful Dakotas.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Then warmly Winona replied, &quot;Tamd&oacute;ka himself is the traitor,<br /></span>
<span>And the brave-hearted stranger had died by his treacherous hand in the forest,<br /></span>
<span>But thy daughter's voice bade him beware of the sly death that followed his footsteps.<br /></span>
<span>The words of Tamd&oacute;ka are fair, but his heart is the den of the serpents.<br /></span>
<span>When the braves told their tale like a bird sang the heart of Winona rejoicing,<br /></span>
<span>But gladlier still had she heard of the death of the crafty Tamd&oacute;ka.<br /></span>
<span>The Chief will return; he is bold, and he carries the fire of Wak&iacute;nyan:<br /></span>
<span>To our people the truth will be told, and Tamd&oacute;ka will hide like a coward.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>His thin locks the aged brave shook; to himself half inaudibly muttered;<br /></span>
<span>To Winona no answer he spoke,&mdash;only moaned he &quot;<i>Mic&uacute;nksee! Mic&uacute;nksee</i>!<a name='FNanchor_BI'></a><a href='#Footnote_BI'><sup>[BI]</sup></a><br /></span>

<h4>FAMINE.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span><i>Waz&iacute;ya</i> came down from the North&mdash;from the land of perpetual winter.<br /></span>
<span>From his frost-covered beard issued forth the sharp-biting, shrill-whistling North-wind;<br /></span>
<span>At the touch of his breath the wide earth turned to stone, and the lakes and the rivers:<br /></span>
<span>From his nostrils the white vapors rose, and they covered the sky like a blanket.<br /></span>
<span>Like the down of <i>Mag&aacute;</i><a name='FNanchor_BK'></a><a href='#Footnote_BK'><sup>[BK]</sup></a> fell the snows, tossed and whirled into heaps by the North-wind.<br /></span>
<span>Then the blinding storms roared on the plains, like the simoons on sandy Sahara;<br /></span>
<span>From the fangs of the fierce hurricanes fled the elk and the deer and the bison.<br /></span>
<span>Ever colder and colder it grew, till the frozen ground cracked and split open;<br /></span>
<span>And harder and harder it blew, till the hillocks were bare as the boulders.<br /></span>
<span>To the southward the buffalos fled, and the white rabbits hid in their burrows;<br /></span>
<span>On the bare sacred mounds of the dead howled the gaunt, hungry wolves in the night-time,<br /></span>
<span>The strong hunters crouched in their <i>tees</i>; by the lodge-fires the little ones shivered;<br /></span>
<span>And the Magic-Men<a name='FNanchor_BL'></a><a href='#Footnote_BL'><sup>[BL]</sup></a> danced to appease, in their <i>teepee</i>, the wrath of <i>Waz&iacute;ya</i>;<br /></span>
<span>But famine and fatal disease, like phantoms, crept into the village.<br /></span>
<span>The Hard Moon<a name='FNanchor_BM'></a><a href='#Footnote_BM'><sup>[BM]</sup></a> was past, but the moon when the coons make their trails in the forest<a name='FNanchor_BN'></a><a href='#Footnote_BN'><sup>[BN]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span>Grew colder and colder. The coon, or the bear, ventured not from his cover;<br /></span>
<span>For the cold, cruel Arctic simoon swept the earth like the breath of a furnace.<br /></span>
<span>In the <i>tee</i> of Ta-t&eacute;-psin the store of wild-rice and dried meat was exhausted;<br /></span>
<span>And Famine crept in at the door, and sat crouching and gaunt by the lodge-fire.<br /></span>
<span>But now with the saddle of deer and the gifts came the crafty Tamd&oacute;ka;<br /></span>
<span>And he said, &quot;Lo I bring you good cheer, for I love the blind Chief and his daughter.<br /></span>
<span>Take the gifts of Tamd&oacute;ka, for dear to his heart is the dark-eyed Winona.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>The aged Chief opened his ears; in his heart he already consented:<br /></span>
<span>But the moans of his child and her tears touched the age-softened heart of the father,<br /></span>
<span>And he said, &quot;I am burdened with years,&mdash;I am bent by the snows of my winters;<br /></span>
<span>Ta-t&eacute;-psin will die in his <i>tee</i>; let him pass to the Land of the Spirits;<br /></span>
<span>But Winona is young; she is free and her own heart shall choose her a husband.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>The dark warrior strode from the <i>tee</i>; low-muttering and grim he departed;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Let him die in his lodge,&quot; muttered he, &quot;but Winona shall kindle my lodge-fire.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Then forth went Winona. The bow of Ta-t&eacute;-psin she took and his arrows,<br /></span>
<span>And afar o'er the deep, drifted snow through the forest she sped on her snow shoes.<br /></span>
<span>Over meadow and ice-covered mere, through the thickets of red-oak and hazel,<br /></span>
<span>She followed the tracks of the deer, but like phantoms they fled from her vision.<br /></span>
<span>From sunrise to sunset she sped; half famished she camped in the thicket;<br /></span>
<span>In the cold snow she made her lone bed; on the buds of the birch<a name='FNanchor_BO'></a><a href='#Footnote_BO'><sup>[BO]</sup></a> made her supper.<br /></span>
<span>To the dim moon the gray owl preferred, from the tree-top, his shrill lamentation,<br /></span>
<span>And around her at midnight she heard the dread famine-cries of the gray wolves.<br /></span>
<span>In the gloam of the morning again on the trail of the red-deer she followed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>All day long through the thickets in vain, for the gray wolves were chasing the roebucks;<br /></span>
<span>And the cold, hungry winds from the plain chased the wolves and the deer and Winona.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>In the twilight of sundown she sat in the forest, all weak and despairing;<br /></span>
<span>Ta-t&eacute;-psin's bow lay at her feet, and his otter-skin quiver of arrows<br /></span>
<span>&quot;He promised,&mdash;he promised,&quot; she said,&mdash;half-dreamily uttered and mournful,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;And why comes he not? Is he dead? Was he slain by the crafty Tamd&oacute;ka?<br /></span>
<span>Must Winona, alas, make her choice&mdash;make her choice between death and Tamd&oacute;ka?<br /></span>
<span>She will die, but her soul will rejoice in the far Summer-land of the spirits.<br /></span>
<span>Hark! I hear his low, musical voice! he is coming! My White Chief is coming!<br /></span>
<span>Ah, no, I am half in a dream!&mdash;'twas the memory of days long departed;<br /></span>
<span>But the birds of the green Summer seem to be singing above in the branches.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Then forth from her bosom she drew the crucified Jesus in silver.<br /></span>
<span>In her dark hair the cold north-wind blew, as meekly she bent o'er the image.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;O Christ of the Whiteman,&quot; she prayed, &quot;lead the feet of my brave to Kath&aacute;ga;<br /></span>
<span>Send a good spirit down to my aid, or the friend of the White Chief will perish.&quot;<br /></span>

<span>Thus sadly she chanted, and lo&mdash;allured by her sorrowful accents&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>From the dark covert crept a red roe and wonderingly gazed on Winona.<br /></span>
<span>Then swift caught the huntress her bow; from her trembling hand hummed the keen arrow.<br /></span>
<span>Up-leaped the red roebuck and fled, but the white snow was sprinkled with scarlet,<br /></span>
<span>And he fell in the oak thicket dead. On the trail ran the eager Winona.<br /></span>
<span>Half-famished the raw flesh she ate. To the hungry maid sweet was her supper<br /></span>
<span>Then swift through the night ran her feet, and she trailed the sleek roebuck behind her;<br /></span>
<span>And the guide of her steps was a star&mdash;the cold-glinting star of <i>Waz&iacute;ya</i><a name='FNanchor_BP'></a><a href='#Footnote_BP'><sup>[BP]</sup></a>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Over meadow and hilltop afar, on the way to the lodge of her father.<br /></span>
<span>But hark! on the keen frosty air wind the shrill hunger-howls of the gray-wolves!<br /></span>
<span>And nearer,&mdash;still nearer!&mdash;the blood of the deer have they scented and follow;<br /></span>
<span>Through the thicket, the meadow, the wood, dash the pack on the trail of Winona.<br /></span>
<span>Swift she speeds with her burden, but swift on her track fly the minions of famine;<br /></span>
<span>Now they yell on the view from the drift, in the reeds at the marge of the meadow;<br /></span>
<span>Red gleam their wild, ravenous eyes, for they see on the hill-side their supper;<br /></span>
<span>The dark forest echoes their cries, but her heart is the heart of a warrior.<br /></span>
<span>From its sheath snatched Winona her knife, and a leg from the roebuck she severed;<br /></span>
<span>With the carcass she ran for her life,&mdash;to a low-branching oak ran the maiden;<br /></span>
<span>Round the deer's neck her head-strap<a name='FNanchor_BQ'></a><a href='#Footnote_BQ'><sup>[BQ]</sup></a> was tied; swiftly she sprang to the arms of the oak-tree;<br /></span>
<span>Quick her burden she drew to her side, and higher she clomb on the branches,<br /></span>
<span>While the maddened wolves battled and bled, dealing death o'er the leg to each other;<br /></span>
<span>Their keen fangs devouring the dead,&mdash;yea, devouring the flesh of the living,<br /></span>
<span>They raved and they gnashed and they growled, like the fiends in the regions infernal;<br /></span>
<span>The wide night re-echoing howled, and the hoarse North-wind laughed o'er the slaughter.<br /></span>
<span>But their ravenous maws unappeased by the blood and the flesh of their fellows,<br /></span>
<span>To the cold wind their muzzles they raised, and the trail to the oak-tree they followed.<br /></span>
<span>Round and round it they howled for the prey, madly leaping and snarling and snapping;<br /></span>
<span>But the brave maiden's keen arrows slay, till the dead number more than the living.<br /></span>
<span>All the long, dreary night-time, at bay, in the oak sat the shivering Winona;<br /></span>
<span>But the sun gleamed at last, and away skulked the gray cowards<a name='FNanchor_BR'></a><a href='#Footnote_BR'><sup>[BR]</sup></a> down through the forest.<br /></span>
<span>Then down dropped the deer and the maid. Ere the sun reached the midst of his journey,<br /></span>
<span>Her red, welcome burden she laid at the feet of her famishing father.<br /></span>
<span><i>Waz&iacute;ya's</i> wild wrath was appeased, and homeward he turned to his <i>teepee</i>,<a name='FNanchor_3'></a><a href='#Footnote_3'><sup>[3]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span>O'er the plains and the forest-land breezed from the Islands of Summer the South-wind.<br /></span>
<span>From their dens came the coon and the bear; o'er the snow through the woodlands they wandered;<br /></span>
<span>On her snow-shoes with stout bow and spear on their trails ran the huntress Winona.<br /></span>
<span>The coon to his den in the tree, and the bear to his burrow she followed;<br /></span>
<span>A brave, skillful hunter was she, and Ta-t&eacute;-psin's lodge laughed with abundance.<br /></span>

<h4>DEATH OF TA-TE-PSIN.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>The long winter wanes. On the wings of the spring come the geese and the mallards;<br /></span>
<span>On the bare oak the red-robin sings, and the crocus peeps up on the prairies,<br /></span>
<span>And the bobolink pipes, but he brings of the blue-eyed, brave White Chief no tidings.<br /></span>
<span>With the waning of winter, alas, waned the life of the aged Ta-t&eacute;-psin;<br /></span>
<span>Ere the wild pansies peeped from the grass, to the Land of the Spirits he journeyed;<br /></span>
<span>Like a babe in its slumber he passed, or the snow from the hill-tops of April;<br /></span>
<span>And the dark-eyed Winona, at last, stood alone by the graves of her kindred.<br /></span>
<span>When their myriad mouths opened the trees to the sweet dew of heaven and the raindrops,<br /></span>
<span>And the April showers fell on the leas, on his mound fell the tears of Winona.<br /></span>
<span>Round her drooping form gathered the years and the spirits unseen of her kindred,<br /></span>
<span>As low, in the midst of her tears, at the grave of her father she chanted<br /></span>

<span>Still hope, like a star in the night gleaming oft through the broken clouds somber,<br /></span>
<span>Cheered the heart of Winona, and bright on her dreams beamed the face of the Frenchman.<br /></span>
<span>As the thought of a loved one and lost, sad and sweet were her thoughts of the White Chief;<br /></span>
<span>In the moon's mellow light, like a ghost, walked Winona alone by the <i>Ha-Ha</i>,<br /></span>
<span>Ever wrapped in a dream. Far away&mdash;to the land of the sunrise&mdash;she wandered;<br /></span>
<span>On the blue-rolling <i>T&aacute;nka-Med&eacute;</i><a name='FNanchor_BS'></a><a href='#Footnote_BS'><sup>[BS]</sup></a> in the midst of her dreams, she beheld him&mdash;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span>The moon waxed and waned, but the star of her hope never waned to the setting;<br /></span>

<span>&quot;He will come,&mdash;he is coming,&quot; she said; &quot;he will come, for my White Eagle promised,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>And low to the bare earth the maid bent her ear for the sound of his footsteps,<br /></span>
<span>&quot;He is gone, but his voice in my ear still remains like the voice of the robin;<br /></span>
<span>He is far, but his footsteps I hear; he is coming; my White Chief is coming!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>But the moon waxed and waned. Nevermore will the eyes of Winona behold him.<br /></span>
<span>Far away on the dark, rugged shore of the blue <i>Gitchee G&uacute;mee</i> he lingers.<br /></span>
<span>No tidings the rising sun brings; no tidings the star of the evening;<br /></span>
<span>But morning and evening she sings, like a turtle-dove widowed and waiting:<br /></span>

<h4>DEATH OF WINONA.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Down the broad <i>Ha-Ha W&aacute;k-pa</i><a name='FNanchor_BT'></a><a href='#Footnote_BT'><sup>[BT]</sup></a> the band took their way to the Games at <i>Ke&oacute;za</i><a name='FNanchor_8'></a><a href='#Footnote_8'><sup>[8]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span>While the swift-footed hunters by land ran the shores for the elk and the bison.<br /></span>
<span>Like <i>mag&aacute;s</i><a name='FNanchor_BU'></a><a href='#Footnote_BU'><sup>[BU]</sup></a> ride the birchen canoes on the breast of the dark, winding river,<br /></span>
<span>By the willow-fringed island they cruise, by the grassy hills green to their summits;<br /></span>
<span>By the lofty bluffs hooded with oaks that darken the deep with their shadows;<br /></span>
<span>And bright in the sun gleam the strokes of the oars in the hands of the women.<br /></span>
<span>With the band went Winona. The oar plied the maid with the skill of a hunter.<br /></span>
<span>They tarried a time on the shore of <i>Remn&iacute;ca</i>&mdash;the Lake of the Mountains.<a name='FNanchor_BV'></a><a href='#Footnote_BV'><sup>[BV]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span>There the fleet hunters followed the deer, and the thorny pahin<a name='FNanchor_BW'></a><a href='#Footnote_BW'><sup>[BW]</sup></a> for the women<br /></span>
<span>From the tees rose the smoke of good cheer, curling blue through the tops of the maples,<br /></span>
<span>Near the foot of a cliff that arose, like the battle-scarred walls of a castle,<br /></span>
<span>Up-towering, in rugged repose, to a dizzy height over the waters.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>But the man-wolf still followed his prey, and the step-mother ruled in the teepee;<br /></span>
<span>Her will must Winona obey, by the custom and law of Dakotas.<br /></span>
<span>The gifts to the teepee were brought&mdash;the blankets and beads of the White men,<br /></span>
<span>And Winona, the orphaned, was bought by the crafty, relentless Tamd&oacute;ka.<br /></span>
<span>In the Spring-time of life, in the flush of the gladsome mid-May days of Summer,<br /></span>
<span>When the bobolink sang and the thrush, and the red robin chirped in the branches,<br /></span>
<span>To the tent of the brave must she go; she must kindle the fire in his <i>teepee</i>;<br /></span>
<span>She must sit in the lodge of her foe, as a slave at the feet of her master.<br /></span>
<span>Alas for her waiting! the wings of the East-wind have brought her no tidings;<br /></span>
<span>On the meadow the meadow-lark sings, but sad is her song to Winona,<br /></span>
<span>For the glad warbler's melody brings but the memory of voices departed.<br /></span>
<span>The Day-Spirit walked in the west to his lodge in the land of the shadows;<br /></span>
<span>His shining face gleamed on the crest of the oak-hooded hills and the mountains,<br /></span>
<span>And the meadow-lark hied to her nest, and the mottled owl peeped from her cover.<br /></span>
<span>But hark! from the <i>teepees</i> a cry! Hear the shouts of the hurrying warriors!<br /></span>
<span>Are the feet of the enemy nigh,&mdash;of the crafty and cruel Ojibways?<br /></span>
<span>Nay; look!&mdash;on the dizzy cliff high&mdash;on the brink of the cliff stands Winona!<br /></span>
<span>Her sad face up-turned to the sky. Hark! I hear the wild wail of her death-song:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;My Father's Spirit, look down, look down&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From your hunting grounds in the shining skies;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">His bark sailed over the Sunrise-sea.<br /></span>

<span>Swift the strong hunters climbed as she sang, and the foremost of all was Tamd&oacute;ka;<br /></span>
<span>From crag to crag upward he sprang; like a panther he leaped to the summit.<br /></span>
<span>Too late!&mdash;on the brave as he crept turned the maid in her scorn and defiance;<br /></span>
<span>Then swift from the dizzy height leaped. Like a brant arrow-pierced in mid-heaven.<br /></span>
<span>Down whirling and fluttering she fell, and headlong plunged into the waters.<br /></span>
<span>Forever she sank mid the wail, and the wild lamentation of women.<br /></span>
<span>Her lone spirit evermore dwells in the depths of the Lake of the Mountains,<br /></span>
<span>And the lofty cliff evermore tells to the years as they pass her sad story.<a name='FNanchor_BX'></a><a href='#Footnote_BX'><sup>[BX]</sup></a><br /></span>

<span>As her sad sisters watched on the shore for her spirit to rise from the waters,<br /></span>
<span>They heard the swift dip of an oar, and a boat they beheld like a shadow,<br /></span>
<span>Gliding down through the night in the gray, gloaming mists on the face of the waters.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>When Mollie and I were married from the dear old cottage-home,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the vale between the hills of fir and pine,<br /></span>
<span>I parted with a sigh in a stranger-land to roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And to seek a western home for me and mine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>By a grove-encircled lake in the wild and prairied West,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As the sun was sinking down one summer day,<br /></span>
<span>I laid my knapsack down and my weary limbs to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And resolved to build a cottage-home and stay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>I staked and marked my &quot;corners,&quot; and I &quot;filed&quot; upon my claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I built a cottage-home of &quot;logs and shakes;&quot;<br /></span>
<span>And then I wrote a letter, and Mollie and baby came<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Out to bless me and to bake my johnny-cakes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>When Mollie saw my &quot;cottage&quot; and the way that I had &quot;bached&quot;,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She smiled, but I could see that she was &quot;blue;&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Then she found my &quot;Sunday-clothes&quot; all soiled and torn and patched,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And she hid her face and shed a tear or two.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>But she went to work in earnest and the cabin fairly shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And her dinners were so savory and so nice<br /></span>
<span>That I felt it was &quot;not good that the man should be alone&quot;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even in this lovely land of Paradise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Well, the neighbors they were few and were many miles apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And you couldn't hear the locomotive scream;<br /></span>
<span>But I was young and hardy, and my Mollie gave me heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And my &quot;steers&quot; they made a fast and fancy team.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And the way I broke the sod was a marvel, you can bet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For I fed my &quot;steers&quot; before the dawn of day;<br /></span>
<span>And when the sun went under I was plowing prairie yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till my Mollie blew the old tin horn for tea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And the lazy, lousy &quot;Injuns&quot; came a-loafing round the lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a-begging for a bone or bit of bread;<br /></span>
<span>And the sneaking thieves would steal whatever they could take&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the very house where they were kindly fed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>O the eastern preachers preach, and the long-haired poets sing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the &quot;noble braves&quot; and &quot;dusky maidens fair;&quot;<br /></span>
<span>But if they had pioneered 'twould have been another thing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the &quot;Injuns&quot; got a-hankering for their &quot;hair.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Often when we lay in bed in the middle of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How the prairie-wolves would howl their jubilee!<br /></span>
<span>Then Mollie she would waken in a shiver and a fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Clasp our baby-pet and snuggle up to me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>There were hardships you may guess, and enough of weary toil<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the first few years, but then it was so grand<br /></span>
<span>To see the corn and wheat waving o'er the virgin soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And two stout and loving hearts went hand in hand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>But Mollie took the fever when our second babe was born,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And she lay upon the bed as white as snow;<br /></span>
<span>And my idle cultivator lay a rusting in the corn;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the doctor said poor Mollie she must go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Now I never prayed before, but I fell upon my knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I prayed as never any preacher prayed;<br /></span>
<span>And Mollie always said that it broke the fell disease;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I truly think the Lord He sent us aid:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>For the fever it was broken, and she took a bit of food,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And O then I went upon my knees again;<br /></span>
<span>And I never cried before,&mdash;and I never thought I could,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But my tears they fell upon her hand like rain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And I think the Lord has blessed us ever since I prayed the prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For my crops have never wanted rain or dew:<br /></span>
<span>And Mollie often said in the days of debt and care,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&quot;Don't you worry, John, the Lord will help us through.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>For the &quot;pesky,&quot; painted Sioux, in the fall of 'sixty-two,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Came a-whooping on their ponies o'er the plain,<br /></span>
<span>And they killed my pigs and cattle, and I tell you it looked &quot;blue,&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When they danced around my blazing stacks of grain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And the settlers mostly fled, but I didn't have a chance,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So I caught my hunting-rifle long and true,<br /></span>
<span>And Mollie poured the powder while I made the devils dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To a tune that made 'em jump and tumble, too.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And they fired upon the cabin; 'twas as good as any fort,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But the &quot;beauties&quot; wouldn't give us any rest;<br /></span>
<span>For they skulked and blazed away, and I didn't call it sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For I had to do my very &quot;level best.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Now they don't call <i>me</i> a coward, but my Mollie she's a &quot;brick;&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For she chucked the children down the cellar-way,<br /></span>
<span>And she never flinched a hair tho' the bullets pattered thick,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And we held the &quot;painted beauties&quot; well at bay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>But once when I was aiming, a bullet grazed my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And it cut the scalp and made the air look blue;<br /></span>
<span>Then Mollie straightened up like a soldier and she said:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&quot;Never mind it, John, the Lord will help us through.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And you bet it raised my &quot;grit,&quot; and I never flinched a bit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And my nerves they got as strong as steel or brass;<br /></span>
<span>And when I fired again I was sure that I had hit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For I saw the skulking devil &quot;claw the grass.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Well, the fight was long and hot, and I got a charge of shot<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the shoulder, but it never broke a bone;<br /></span>
<span>And I never stopped to think whether I was hit or not<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till we found our ammunition almost gone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>But the &quot;Rangers&quot; came at last&mdash;just as we were out of lead,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I thanked the Lord, and Mollie thanked Him, too;<br /></span>
<span>Then she put her arms around my neck and sobbed and cried and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&quot;Bless the Lord!&mdash;I knew that He would help us through.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And yonder on the hooks hangs that same old trusty gun,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And above it&mdash;I am sorry they're so few&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Hang the black and braided trophies<a name='FNanchor_BY'></a><a href='#Footnote_BY'><sup>[BY]</sup></a> yet that I and Mollie won<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In that same old bloody battle with the Sioux.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Fifteen years have rolled away since I laid my knapsack down,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And my prairie claim is now one field of grain;<br /></span>
<span>And yonder down the lake loom the steeples of a town,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And my flocks are feeding out upon the plain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>The old log-house is standing filled with bins of corn and wheat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the cars they whistle past our cottage-home;<br /></span>
<span>But my span of spanking trotters they are &quot;just about&quot; as fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I wouldn't give my farm to rule in Rome.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>For Mollie and I are young yet, and monarchs, too, are we&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of a &quot;section&quot; just as good as lies out-doors;<br /></span>
<span>And the children are so happy (and Mollie and I have three)<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And we think that we can &quot;lie upon our oars.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>[Illustration: THE PIONEER]</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>So this summer we went back to the old home by the hill:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O the hills they were so rugged and so tall!<br /></span>
<span>And the lofty pines were gone but the rocks were all there still,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the valleys looked so crowded and so small;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And the dear familiar faces that I longed so much to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Looked so strangely unfamiliar and so old,<br /></span>
<span>That the land of hills and valleys was no more a home to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the river seemed a rivulet as it rolled.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>So I gladly hastened back to the prairies of the West&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the boundless fields of waving grass and corn;<br /></span>
<span>And I love the lake-gemmed land where the wild-goose builds her nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far better than the land where I was born.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And I mean to lay my bones over yonder by the lake&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By and by when I have nothing else to do&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And I'll give the &quot;chicks&quot; the farm, and I know for Mollie's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That the good and gracious Lord will help 'em through.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>I sit once more on breezy shore, at sunset in this glorious June,<br /></span>
<span>I hear the dip of gleaming oar, I list the singers' merry tune.<br /></span>
<span>Beneath my feet the waters beat, and ripple on the polished stones,<br /></span>
<span>The squirrel chatters from his seat; the bag-pipe beetle hums and drones.<br /></span>
<span>The pink and gold in blooming wold,&mdash;the green hills mirrored in the lake!<br /></span>
<span>The deep, blue waters, zephyr-rolled, along the murmuring pebbles break.<br /></span>
<span>The maples screen the ferns, and lean the leafy lindens o'er the deep;<br /></span>
<span>The sapphire, set in emerald green, lies like an Orient gem asleep.<br /></span>
<span>The crimson west glows like the breast of <i>Rhuddin</i><a name='FNanchor_CB'></a><a href='#Footnote_CB'><sup>[CB]</sup></a> when he pipes in May,<br /></span>
<span>As downward droops the sun to rest, and shadows gather on the bay.<br /></span>
<span>In amber sky the swallows fly and sail and circle o'er the deep;<br /></span>
<span>The light-winged night-hawks whir and cry; the silver pike and salmon leap.<br /></span>
<span>The rising moon, o'er isle and dune, looks laughing down on lake and lea;<br /></span>
<span>Weird o'er the waters shrills the loon; the high stars twinkle in the sea.<br /></span>
<span>From bank and hill the whippowil sends piping forth his flute-like notes,<br /></span>
<span>And clear and shrill the answers trill from leafy isles and silver throats.<br /></span>
<span>The twinkling light on cape and height; the hum of voices on the shores;<br /></span>
<span>The merry laughter on the night; the dip and plash of frolic oars,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>These tell the tale. On hill and dale the cities pour their gay and fair;<br /></span>
<span>Along the sapphire lake they sail, and quaff like wine the balmy air.<br /></span>
<span>'Tis well. Of yore from isle and shore the smoke of Indian <i>teepees</i><a name='FNanchor_CC'></a><a href='#Footnote_CC'><sup>[CC]</sup></a> rose;<br /></span>
<span>The hunter plied the silent oar; the forest lay in still repose.<br /></span>
<span>The moon-faced maid, in leafy glade, her warrior waited from the chase;<br /></span>
<span>The nut-brown, naked children played, and chased the gopher on the grass.<br /></span>
<span>The dappled fawn on wooded lawn, peeped out upon the birch canoe,<br /></span>
<span>Swift-gliding in the gray of dawn along the silent waters blue.<br /></span>
<span>In yonder tree the great Wanm-dee<a name='FNanchor_CD'></a><a href='#Footnote_CD'><sup>[CD]</sup></a> securely built her spacious nest;<br /></span>
<span>The blast that swept the landlocked sea<a name='FNanchor_CE'></a><a href='#Footnote_CE'><sup>[CE]</sup></a> but rocked her clamorous babes to rest.<br /></span>
<span>By grassy mere the elk and deer gazed on the hunter as he came;<br /></span>
<span>Nor fled with fear from bow or spear;&mdash;&quot;so wild were they that they were tame.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Ah, birch canoe, and hunter, too, have long forsaken lake and shore;<br /></span>
<span>He bade his fathers' bones adieu and turned away forevermore.<br /></span>
<span>But still, methinks, on dusky brinks the spirit of the warrior moves;<br /></span>
<span>At crystal springs the hunter drinks, and nightly haunts the spot he loves.<br /></span>
<span>For oft at night I see the light of lodge-fires on the shadowy shores,<br /></span>
<span>And hear the wail some maiden's sprite above her slaughtered warrior pours.<br /></span>
<span>I hear the sob, on Spirit Knob,<a name='FNanchor_CA'></a><a href='#Footnote_CA'><sup>[CA]</sup></a> of Indian mother o'er her child;<br /></span>
<span>And on the midnight waters throb her low <i>yun-he-he's</i><a name='FNanchor_CF'></a><a href='#Footnote_CF'><sup>[CF]</sup></a> weird and wild:<br /></span>
<span>And sometimes, too, the light canoe glides like a shadow o'er the deep<br /></span>
<span>At midnight when the moon is low, and all the shores are hushed in sleep.<br /></span>
<span>Alas,&mdash;Alas!&mdash;for all things pass; and we shall vanish too, as they;<br /></span>
<span>We build our monuments of brass, and granite, but they waste away.<br /></span>

<h4>THE BRAVE FERRY-MAN</h4>

<blockquote><p>[NOTE.&mdash;The great Sioux massacre in Minnesota commenced at the Agency village, on the Minnesota
River, early in the morning of the 16th day of August, 1862, precipitated, doubtless, by the
murders at Acton on the day previous. The massacre and the Indian war that followed developed
many brave men, but no truer hero than Mauley, an obscure Frenchman, the ferry-man at the
Agency. Continually under fire, he resolutely ran his ferry-boat back and forth across the river,
affording the terror-stricken people the only chance for escape. He was shot down on his boat just
as he had landed on the opposite shore the last of those who fled from the burning village to the
ferry-landing. The Indians disemboweled his dead body, cut off the head, hands and feet and
thrust them into the cavity. See <i>Heard's Hist. Sioux War</i>, p 67.]</p></blockquote>

<span>But there be men would grumble at their lot,<br /></span>
<span>Even if it were a corner-lot on Broadway.<br /></span>
<span>We stand upon the shoulders of the past.<br /></span>
<span>Who knoweth not the past how may he know<br /></span>
<span>The folly or the wisdom of to-day?<br /></span>
<span>For by comparison we weigh the good,<br /></span>
<span>And by comparison all evil weigh.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;What can we reason, but from what we know?&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Let honest men look back an hundred years&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Nay, fifty, and behold the wondrous change.<br /></span>
<span>Where wooden tubs like sluggards sailed the sea,<br /></span>
<span>Steam-ships of steel like greyhounds course the main;<br /></span>
<span>Where lumbering coach and wain and wagon toiled<br /></span>
<span>Through mud and mire and rut and rugged way,<br /></span>
<span>The cushioned train a mile a minute flies.<br /></span>
<span>Then by slow coach the message went and came,<br /></span>
<span>But now by lightning bridled to man's use<br /></span>
<span>We flash our silent thoughts from sea to sea;<br /></span>
<span>Nay, under ocean's depths from shore to shore;<br /></span>
<span>And talk by telephone to distant ears.<br /></span>
<span>The dreams of yesterday are deeds to-day.<br /></span>
<span>Our frugal mothers spun with tedious toil,<br /></span>
<span>And wove the homespun cloth for all their fold;<br /></span>
<span>Their needles plied by weary fingers sewed.<br /></span>
<span>Behold, the humming factory spins and weaves,<br /></span>
<span>The singing &quot;Singer&quot; sews with lightning speed.<br /></span>
<span>Our fathers sowed their little fields by hand,<br /></span>
<span>And reaped with bended sickles and bent backs;<br /></span>
<span>By hand they bound the sheaves of wheat and rye;<br /></span>
<span>With flails they threshed and winnowed in the wind.<br /></span>
<span>Now by machines we sow and reap and bind;<br /></span>
<span>By steam we thresh and sack the bounteous grain.<br /></span>
<span>These are but few of all the million ways<br /></span>

<span>The peace of peasants; heard the merry song<br /></span>
<span>Of mowers singing to the swing of scythes,<br /></span>
<span>The solemn-voiced, low-wailing funeral dirge<br /></span>
<span>Winding slow-paced with death to humble graves;<br /></span>
<span>And heard the requiem sung for coffined kings.<br /></span>

<span>Blood-fertiled with ten thousand flattered fools<br /></span>
<span>Who, but to please the vanity of one,<br /></span>
<span>Marched on hurrahing to the doom of death&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And spake not, neither sighed nor made a moan.<br /></span>
<span>Saw from the blood of heroes roses spring,<br /></span>
<span>And where the clangor of steel-sinewed War<br /></span>
<span>Roared o'er embattled rage, heard gentle Peace<br /></span>
<span>To bleating hills and vales of rustling gold<br /></span>
<span>Flute her glad notes from morn till even-tide.<br /></span>
<span>Grim with the grime of a thousand years he stood&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Grand in his silence, mighty in his years.<br /></span>
<span>Under his shade the maid and lover wooed;<br /></span>
<span>Under his arms their children's children played<br /></span>
<span>And lambkins gamboled; at his feet by night<br /></span>
<span>The heart-sick wanderer laid him down and died,<br /></span>
<span>And he looked on in silence.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">Silent hours<br /></span>
<span>In ghostly pantomime on tip-toe tripped<br /></span>
<span>The stately minuet of the passing years,<br /></span>

<span>Black Thunder growled and from his throne of gloom<br /></span>
<span>Fire-flashed the night with hissing bolt, and lo,<br /></span>

<span>Uttered one voice and like a Titan fell,<br /></span>

<span>On the Spirit-Island <a name='FNanchor_CI'></a><a href='#Footnote_CI'><sup>[CI]</sup></a> sitting under midnight's misty moon,<br /></span>
<span>Lo I see the spirits flitting o'er the waters one by one!<br /></span>

<span>One lone whippowil's shrill ditty calls her mate that ne'er will   come.<br /></span>

<span>Through the glamour and the gloaming comes a spirit of the dead.<br /></span>

<span>All but brave <i>Wan&acirc;ta</i> wondered, and the gods with fear implored.<br /></span>
<span>When the war-whoop shrill resounded, calling friends to meet the foe,<br /></span>
<span>From the <i>teepee</i> swift he bounded, armed with polished lance and bow.<br /></span>
<span>In the battle's din and clangor fast his fatal arrows flew,<br /></span>
<span>Flashed his fiery eyes with anger,&mdash;many a stealthy foe he slew.<br /></span>
<span>Hunter swift was he and cunning, caught the beaver, slew the bear,<br /></span>
<span>Overtook the roebuck running, dragged the panther from his lair.<br /></span>
<span>Loved was he by many a maiden; many a dark eye glanced in vain;<br /></span>
<span>Many a heart with sighs was laden for the love it could not gain.<br /></span>
<span>So they called the brave &quot;<i>Ska C&acirc;pa</i>;&quot;<a name='FNanchor_CJ'></a><a href='#Footnote_CJ'><sup>[CJ]</sup></a> but the fairest of the band&mdash;<br /></span>

<span>Waiting the signal of battle on the Gettysburg hills that day.<br /></span>

<span>Rumbled and roared at the front the bellowing guns of the foe<br /></span>
<span>Swelling the chorus of hell ever louder and deadlier still,<br /></span>
<span>And shrill o'er the roar of the cannon rose the yell of the rebels below,<br /></span>
<span>As they charged on our Third Corps advanced and crushed in the lines at a blow.<br /></span>
<span>Leading his clamorous legions, flashing his saber in air,<br /></span>
<span>Forward rode furious Longstreet charging on Round Top there&mdash;<br /></span>

<span>Prone on the earth that shuddered under us there as we lay.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Good morning&mdash;good morning&mdash;a happy new year!<br /></span>
<span>We greet you, kind friends of the old <i>Pioneer</i>;<br /></span>
<span>Hope your coffee is good and your steak is well done,<br /></span>
<span>And you're happy as clams in the sand and the sun.<br /></span>
<span>The old year's a shadow&mdash;a shade of the past;<br /></span>
<span>It is gone with its toils and its triumphs so vast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>With its joys and its tears&mdash;with its pleasure and pain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>With its shouts of the brave and its heaps of the slain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Gone&mdash;and it cometh&mdash;no, never again.<br /></span>
<span>And as we look forth on the future so fair<br /></span>
<span>Let us brush from the picture the visage of care;<br /></span>
<span>The error, the folly, the frown and the tear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Drop them all at the grave of the silent old year.<br /></span>
<span>Has the heart been oppressed with a burden of woe?<br /></span>
<span>Has the spirit been cowed by a merciless blow?<br /></span>
<span>Has the tongue of the brave or the voice of the fair<br /></span>
<span>Prayed to God and received no response to its prayer?<br /></span>
<span>Look up!&mdash;'twas a shadow&mdash;the morning is here:<br /></span>
<span>A Happy New Year!&mdash;O, a Happy New Year!<br /></span>
<span>Yet stay for a moment. We cannot forget<br /></span>
<span>The fields where the true and the traitor have met;<br /></span>
<span>When the old year came in we were trembling with fear<br /></span>
<span>Lest Freedom should fall in her glorious career;<br /></span>
<span>And the roar of the conflict was loud o'er the land<br /></span>
<span>Where the traitor-flag waved in a rebel's red hand;<br /></span>
<span>But the God of the Just led the hosts of the Free,<br /></span>
<span>And Victory marched from the north to the sea.<br /></span>
<span>Behold&mdash;where the conflict was doubtful and dire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>There&mdash;on house-top and hill-top, on fortress and spire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The Old Banner waves again higher and prouder,<br /></span>
<span>Though torn by the shot and begrimed by the powder.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>God bless the brave soldiers that followed that flag<br /></span>
<span>Through river and swamp, over mountain and crag&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>On the wild charge triumphant&mdash;the sullen retreat&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>On fields spread with victory or piled with defeat;<br /></span>
<span>God bless their true hearts for they stood like a wall,<br /></span>
<span>And saved us our Country and saved us our all.<br /></span>
<span>But many a mother and many a daughter<br /></span>
<span>Weep, alas, o'er the brave that went down in the slaughter.<br /></span>
<span>Pile the monuments high&mdash;not on hill-top and plain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>To the glorious sons 'neath the old banner slain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>But over the land from the sea to the sea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Pile their monuments high in the hearts of the Free.<br /></span>
<span>Heaven bless the brave souls that are spared to return<br /></span>
<span>Where the &quot;lamp in the window&quot; ceased never to burn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Where the vacant chair stood at the desolate hearth<br /></span>
<span>Since the son shouldered arms or the father went forth.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Peace!&mdash;Peace!&quot;&mdash;was the shout;&mdash;at the jubilant word<br /></span>
<span>Wives and mothers went down on their knees to the Lord!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span>A gray-haired old veteran in arm-chair at ease,<br /></span>
<span>With his grandchildren clustered intent at his knees,<br /></span>
<span>Recounting his deeds with an eloquent tongue,<br /></span>
<span>And a fire that enkindles the hearts of the young;<br /></span>
<span>How he followed the Flag from the first to the last&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>On the long, weary march, in the battle's hot blast;<br /></span>
<span>How he marched under Sherman from center to sea,<br /></span>
<span>Or fought under Grant in his battles with Lee;<br /></span>
<span>And the old fire comes back to his eye as of yore,<br /></span>
<span>And his iron hand clutches his musket once more,<br /></span>
<span>As of old on the battle-field ghastly and red,<br /></span>
<span>When he sprang to the charge o'er the dying and dead;<br /></span>
<span>And the eyes of his listeners are gleaming with fire,<br /></span>
<span>As he points to that Flag floating high on the spire.<br /></span>

<span>For flashes of wit or the holy afflatus,<br /></span>
<span>And imagine we hear the applause of a nation,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>But all honest men who are married and blest<br /></span>
<span>Will agree that the last work of God is the best.<br /></span>

<span>Happy houses, happy hearts&mdash;and a happy New Year!<br /></span>

<span>Thus was called my Father-land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Why weeps the minstrel's Father-land?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">On Liberty to bare her arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On Retribution's vengeful hand:<br /></span>
<span>On these she calls&mdash;my Father-land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>What would the minstrel's Father-land?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She would strike the base slaves to the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Chase from her soil the tyrant hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And free her sons in shackles bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or lay them free beneath her sand:<br /></span>
<span>That would my Father-land.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And hopes the minstrel's Father-land?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She hopes for holy Freedom's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hopes that her true sons will awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hopes that just God will vengeance take,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And ne'er mistakes the Avenger's hand:<br /></span>
<span>Thereon relies my Father-land.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">But there came to town<br /></span>
<span class="i4">One Captain Brown<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To spend a month or more.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now this same Captain Brown<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Was a man of renown,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">And a bright, brass star.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And a visible scar<br /></span>
<span>On his brow&mdash;that he said he had got in the war<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As he led the van:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">(He never ran!)<br /></span>
<span>In short, he was the &quot;General's&quot; right-hand man,<br /></span>
<span>And had written his name on the pages of fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He was smooth as an eel,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And rode so genteel<br /></span>
<span>That in less than a week every old maid and dame<br /></span>
<span>Was constantly lisping the bold Captain's name.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Now Mr. McNair,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As well as the fair,<br /></span>
<span>Had a &quot;bump of reverence&quot; as big as a pear,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And whoever like Brown<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Had a little renown,<br /></span>
<span>And happened to visit that rural town,<br /></span>
<span>Was invited of course by McNair&mdash;to &quot;go down.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">So merely by chance,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The son of the lance<br /></span>
<span>Became the bold hero of quite a romance:<br /></span>
<span>For Mrs. McNair thought him wonderful fair,<br /></span>
<span>And that none but her husband could with him compare.<br /></span>
<span>Half her timidity vanished in air<br /></span>
<span>The first time he dined with herself and McNair.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now the Captain was arch<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In whiskers and starch<br /></span>
<span>And preferred, now and then, a gay waltz to a march.<br /></span>
<span>A man, too, he was of uncommon good taste;<br /></span>
<span>Always &quot;at home&quot; and never in haste,<br /></span>
<span>And his manners and speech were remarkably chaste.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To tell you in short<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His daily resort<br /></span>
<span>He made at the house of &quot;his good friend McNair,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Who ('twas really too bad) was so frequently out<br /></span>
<span>When the Captain called in &quot;just to see <i>him</i>&quot; (no doubt)<br /></span>
<span>But Mrs. McNair was so lonely&mdash;too bad;<br /></span>
<span>So he chatted and chattered and made her look glad.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And many a view<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of his coat of blue,<br /></span>
<span>All studded with buttons gilt, spangled and new,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The dear lady took<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Half askance from her book,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">And modestly she<br /></span>
<span>Talked nonsense and sense so strangely commingled,<br /></span>
<span>That the dear lady's heart was delighted and tingled.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A man of sobriety<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Renown and variety<br /></span>
<span>It could not be wrong to enjoy his society:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">O was it a sin<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For him to &quot;drop in,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>And sometimes to pat her in sport on the chin?<br /></span>

<span>Flirtations once led to the siege of old Troy;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And a woman was in<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For the sorrow and sin<br /></span>
<span>And slaughter that fell when the Greeks tumbled in;<br /></span>
<span>Nor is there a doubt, my dears, under the sun,<br /></span>
<span>But they've led to the sack of more cities than one.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I would we were all<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As pure as Saint Paul<br /></span>
<span>That we touched not the goblet whose lees are but gall;<br /></span>

<span>Then he gave her a ring, begged a curl of her hair,<br /></span>
<span>And smilingly whispered her&mdash;&quot;don't tell McNair.&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">She dropped her dark eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And with two little sighs<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Then alas&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">What a pass!<br /></span>
<span>He fell at the feet of the lady so sweet,<br /></span>

<span>With all his humanity&mdash;body and soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The lady so frail<br /></span>

<span class="i4">She agreed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Were she only a maid he alone could succeed;<br /></span>

<span>Not to rouse the suspicion of Mr. McNair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Twas really too bad,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For the lady was sad:<br /></span>
<span>And a terrible night o't the poor lady had,<br /></span>
<span>While Mr. McNair wondered what was the matter,<br /></span>
<span>And endeavored to coax, to console and to flatter.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Many tears she shed<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That night while in bed<br /></span>
<span>For she had such a terrible pain in her head!<br /></span>
<span>&quot;My dear little pet, where's the camphor?&quot; he said;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;I'll go for the doctor&mdash;you'll have to be bled;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span>I know what it is&mdash;I have had it before&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>It's only neuralgia: please go to the store<br /></span>
<span>And bring me a bottle of 'Davis's Pain-<br /></span>
<span>Killer,' and I shall be better again.&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He sprang out of bed<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And away he sped<br /></span>
<span>In his gown for the cordial to cure her head,<br /></span>
<span>Not dreaming that Cupid had played her a trick&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The blind little rogue with a sharpened stick.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I confess on my knees<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I have had the disease;<br /></span>
<span>It is worse than the bites of a thousand fleas;<br /></span>
<span>And the only cure I have found for these ills<br /></span>
<span>Is a double dose of &quot;Purgative Pills.&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He rubbed her head&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And eased it, she said;<br /></span>
<span>And he shrugged and shivered and got into bed.<br /></span>
<span>He slept and he snored, but the poor lady's pain,<br /></span>
<span>When her lord slept soundly, came on again.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">It wore away<br /></span>
<span class="i4">However by day<br /></span>
<span>And when Brown called again she was smiling and gay;<br /></span>
<span>But alas, he must say&mdash;to the lady's dismay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>In the town of his heart he had staid out his stay,<br /></span>
<span>And must leave for his regiment with little delay.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Now Mrs. McNair<br /></span>

<span>When a maid she had suitors as proud as Ulysses,<br /></span>
<span>But she ne'er bent her neck to their arms or their kisses,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Till McNair he came in<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With a brush on his chin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>It was love at first sight&mdash;but a trifle too thin;<br /></span>
<span>For, married, the dreams of her girlhood fell short all,<br /></span>
<span>And she found that her husband was only a mortal.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Dear ladies, betray us&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i4">But then I'm so funny<br /></span>
<span class="i4">If he'd give up the money,<br /></span>

<span>For Mr. McNair&mdash;when the fellow came back&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Might go crazy and foolishly follow their track.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So at midnight should wait<br /></span>
<span class="i4">At her garden-gate<br /></span>
<span>A carriage to carry the dear, precious freight<br /></span>
<span>Of Mrs. McNair who should meet Captain Brown<br /></span>
<span>At the Globe Hotel in a neighboring town.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A man should be hired<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To convey the admired.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Wearily, wearily half the night<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The lady watched away;<br /></span>
<span>At times in a spirit of sadness quite,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">She longed to be under way;<br /></span>
<span>Yet with sad heaving heart and a tear, I declare,<br /></span>
<span>As she sorrowfully thought of poor Mr. McNair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;Poor fellow,&quot; she sighed,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&quot;I wish he had died<br /></span>
<span>Last spring when he had his complaint in the side<br /></span>
<span>For I know&mdash;I am sure&mdash;it will terribly grieve him<br /></span>
<span>To have me elope with the Captain and leave him.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But the Captain&mdash;dear me!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I hardly can see<br /></span>
<span>Why I love the brave Captain to such a degree:<br /></span>
<span>But see&mdash;there's the carriage, I vow, at the gate!<br /></span>
<span>I must go&mdash;'tis the law of inveterate fate.&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So a parting look<br /></span>
<span class="i4">At her home she took,<br /></span>
<span>While a terrible conflict her timid soul shook;<br /></span>
<span>Then turned to the carriage heart-stricken and sore,<br /></span>
<span>Stepped hastily in and closed up the door.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&quot;Crack!&quot; went the whip;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">She bit her white lip,<br /></span>
<span>And away she flew on her desperate trip.<br /></span>
<span>She thought of dear Brown; and poor Mr. McNair&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>She knew he would hang himself straight in despair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">She sighed<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Three times she prayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Three times she essayed<br /></span>

<span class="i4">To drive her straight<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To her garden-gate,<br /></span>
<span>And break the spell of her terrible fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But her tongue was tied&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">She couldn't decide,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">A single hair<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For Mr. McNair<br /></span>
<span>She vowed to herself that she did not care;<br /></span>

<span class="i4">In his coat of blue&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>To his loving arms in her fancy she flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In a moment or more<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They drove up to the door,<br /></span>
<span>And she felt that her trials and troubles were o'er.<br /></span>
<span>The landlord came hastily out in his slippers,<br /></span>
<span>For late he had sat with some smokers and sippers.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As the lady stepped down<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With a fret and a frown,<br /></span>
<span>She sighed half aloud, &quot;Where is dear Captain Brown?&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;This way, my dear madam,&quot; politely he said,<br /></span>
<span>And straightway to the parlor the lady he led.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Now the light was dim<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where she followed him,<br /></span>
<span>And the dingy old parlor looked gloomy and grim.<br /></span>

<span>In the farther corner the bold Captain stood<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In his coat of blue:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To his arms she flew;<br /></span>
<span>She buried her face in his bosom so true:<br /></span>

<span>Then she raised her dark eyes and&mdash;Good Heavens'<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I declare!&mdash;-<br /></span>
<span>Instead of the Captain 'twas&mdash;<i>Mr. McNair!</i><br /></span>
<span>She threw up her arms&mdash;she screamed&mdash;and she fainted;<br /></span>
<span>Such a scene!&mdash;Ah the like of it never was painted.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span>Of the sad mischance suffice it to say<br /></span>
<span>That McNair had suspected the Captain's &quot;foul play;&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So he laid a snare<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For the bold and the fair,<br /></span>
<span>But he captured, alas, only Mrs. McNair;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Once Satan and a monk went on a &quot;drunk,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>And Satan struck a bargain with the monk,<br /></span>
<span>Whereby the Devil's crew was much increased<br /></span>
<span>By penceless poor and now and then a priest<br /></span>
<span>Who, lacking cunning or good common sense,<br /></span>
<span>Got caught <i>in flagrante</i> and out of pence.<br /></span>
<span>Then in high glee the Devil filled a cup<br /></span>
<span>And drank a brimming bumper to the pope:<br /></span>
<span>Then&mdash;&quot;Here's to you,&quot; he said, &quot;sober or drunk,<br /></span>
<span>In cowl or corsets, every monk's a punk.<br /></span>
<span>Whate'er they preach unto the common breed,<br /></span>
<span>At heart the priests and I are well agreed.<br /></span>
<span>Justice is blind we see, and deaf and old,<br /></span>
<span>But in her scales can hear the clink of gold.<br /></span>
<span>The convent is a harem in disguise,<br /></span>
<span>And virtue is a fig-leaf for the wise<br /></span>
<span>To hide the naked truth of lust and lecheries.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;And still the toilers feed the pious breed,<br /></span>
<span>And pin their faith upon the bishop's sleeve;<br /></span>
<span>Hungry for hope they gulp a moldy creed<br /></span>
<span>And dine on faith. 'Tis easier to believe<br /></span>
<span>An old-time fiction than to wear a tooth<br /></span>
<span>In gnawing bones to reach the marrow truth.<br /></span>
<span>Priests murder Truth and with her gory ghost<br /></span>
<span>They frighten fools and give the rogues a roast<br /></span>
<span>Until without or pounds or pence or price&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Free as the fabled wine of paradise&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>They furnish priestly plates with buttered toast.<br /></span>
<span>Your priests of superstition stalk the land<br /></span>
<span>With Jacob's winning voice and Esau's hand;<br /></span>
<span>Sinners to hell and saints to heaven they call,<br /></span>
<span>And eat the fattest fodder in the stall.<br /></span>
<span>They, versed in dead rituals in dead language deep,<br /></span>
<span>Talk Greek to th' <i>grex</i> and Latin to their sheep,<br /></span>
<span>And feed their flocks a flood of cant and college<br /></span>
<span>For every drop of sense or useful knowledge.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; softly said the monk,<br /></span>
<span>&quot;I fear your Majesty is raving drunk.<br /></span>
<span>I would be courteous.&quot;<br /></span>
<span class="i18">But the Devil laughed<br /></span>
<span>And slyly winked and sagely shook his head.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;My fawning dog,&quot; the sage satanic said,<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Wags not his tail for me but for my bread.<br /></span>
<span>Brains rule to day as they have ruled for aye,<br /></span>
<span>And craft grown craftier in this modern day<br /></span>
<span>Still rides the fools, but in a craftier way;<br /></span>
<span>And priestcraft lingers and survives its use;<br /></span>
<span>What was a blessing once is now abuse:<br /></span>
<span>Grown fat and arrogant on power and pelf,<br /></span>
<span>The old-time shepherd has become a wolf<br /></span>
<span>And only feeds his flocks to feast himself.<br /></span>
<span>To clink of coin the pious juggler jumps,<br /></span>
<span>For still he thinks, as in the days of old,<br /></span>
<span>The key to holy heaven is made of gold,<br /></span>
<span>That in the game of mortals money is trumps,<br /></span>
<span>That golden darts will pierce e'en Virtue's shield,<br /></span>
<span>And by the salve of gold all sins are healed.<br /></span>
<span>So old Saint Peter stands outside the fence<br /></span>
<span>With hand outstretched for toll of Peter-pence,<br /></span>
<span>And sinners' souls must groan in Purgatory<br /></span>
<span>Until they pay the admission-fee to glory.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;There was an honest poet once on earth<br /></span>
<span>Who beat all other bardies at a canter;<br /></span>
<span>Rob' Burns his mother called him at his birth.<br /></span>
<span>Though handicapped by rum and much a ranter,<br /></span>
<span>He won the madcap race in <i>Tam O'Shanter</i>.<br /></span>
<span>He drove a spanking span from Scottish heather,<br /></span>
<span>Strong-limbed, but light of foot as flea or feather&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Rhyme and Reason, matched and yoked together,<br /></span>
<span>And reined them with light hand and limber leather.<br /></span>
<span>He wrote to me once on a time&mdash;I mind it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>A bold epistle and the poet signed it.<br /></span>
<span>He thought to cheat &quot;Auld Nickie&quot; of his dues,<br /></span>
<span>But who outruns the Devil casts his shoes;<br /></span>
<span>And so at last from frolicking and drinkin',<br /></span>
<span>'Some luckless hour' sent him to Hell 'alinkin'!<a name='FNanchor_CX'></a><a href='#Footnote_CX'><sup>[CX]</sup></a><br /></span>
<span>Times had been rather dull in my dominion,<br /></span>
<span>And all my imps like lubbers lay a snoring,<br /></span>
<span>But Burns began to rhyme us his opinion,<br /></span>
<span>And in ten minutes had all Hell aroaring.<br /></span>
<span>Then Robbie pulled his book of poems out<br /></span>
<span>And read us sundry satires from the book;<br /></span>
<span>'<i>Death and Doctor Hornbook</i>' raised a shout<br /></span>
<span>Till all the roof-tin on the rafters shook;<br /></span>
<span>And when his '<i>Unco Guid</i>' the bardie read<br /></span>
<span>The crew all clapped their hands and yelled like mad;<br /></span>
<span>But '<i>Holy Willie's Prayer</i>' 'brought down the house'.<br /></span>
<span>So I was glad to give the bard a pass<br /></span>
<span>And a few pence for toll at Peter's gate;<br /></span>
<span>For if the roof of Hell were made of brass<br /></span>
<span>Bob Burns would shake it off as sure as fate.<br /></span>
<span>I mind it well&mdash;that poem on a louse!<br /></span>
<span>'O wad some pow'r the giftie gie us,' Monk,<br /></span>
<span>'To see oursels as others see us'&mdash;drunk;<br /></span>
<span>'It wad frae monie a blunder free us'&mdash;list!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'And foolish notion.' Abbot, bishop, priest,<br /></span>
<span>'What airs in dress an' gait wad lea'e' you all,<br /></span>
<span>'And ev'n devotion.' Cowls and robes would fall,<br /></span>
<span>And sometimes leave a bishop but a beast,<br /></span>
<span>And show a leper sore where erst they made a priest.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Not to be beat the jolly monk filled up<br /></span>
<span>His silver mug with rare old Burgundy;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Here's to your health,&quot; he said, &quot;your Majesty&quot;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And drained the brimming goblet at a gulp&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;'For when the Devil was sick the Devil a monk would be;<br /></span>
<span>But when the Devil got well a devil a monk was he.'<br /></span>
<span><i>In vino veritas</i> is true, no doubt&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>When wine goes in teetotal truth comes out.<br /></span>
<span>To shake a little Shakespeare in the wine:<br /></span>
<span>'Some rise by sin and some by virtue fall';<br /></span>
<span>But in the realm of Fate, as I opine,<br /></span>
<span>A devil a virtue is or sin at all.<br /></span>
<span>'The Devil be damned' is what we preach, you know it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>At mass and vespers, holy-bread and dinner:<br /></span>
<span>From priest to pope, from pedagogue to poet,<br /></span>
<span>We sanctify the sin and damn the sinner.<br /></span>
<span>This poet Shakespeare, whom I read with pleasure,<br /></span>
<span>Wrote once&mdash;I think, in taking his own 'Measure':&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'They say best men are molded out of faults,<br /></span>
<span>And, for the most, become much more the better<br /></span>
<span>For being a little bad.' The reason halts:<br /></span>
<span>If read between the lines&mdash;not by the letter&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>'Tis plain enough that Shakespeare was atrimmin'<br /></span>
<span>His own unruly ship and furling sail<br /></span>
<span>To meet a British tempest or a gale,<br /></span>
<span>And keep cold water from his wine and women.<br /></span>
<span>Now I'll admit, when he's a little mellow,<br /></span>
<span>The Devil himself's a devilish clever fellow,<br /></span>
<span>And, though his cheeks and paunch are somewhat shrunk,<br /></span>
<span>He only lacks a cowl to make a monk.<br /></span>
<span>Time is the mother of twins <i>et hic et nunc;</i><br /></span>
<span>Come, hood your horns and fill the mug abrimmin',<br /></span>
<span>For we are cheek by jowl on wit and wine and women.&quot;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>And so the monk and Devil filled the mug,<br /></span>
<span>And quaffed and chaffed and laughed the night away;<br /></span>
<span>And when the &quot;wee sma&quot; hours of night had come,<br /></span>
<span>The monk slipped out and stole the abbot's rum;<br /></span>
<span>And when the abbot came at break of day,<br /></span>
<span>There cheek by jowl&mdash;horns, hoofs, and hood&mdash;they lay,<br /></span>
<span>With open missal and an empty jug,<br /></span>
<span>And broken beads and badly battered mug&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>In fond embrace&mdash;dead drunk upon the rug.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Think not, wise reader, that the bard hath drunk<br /></span>
<span>The wine that fumed these vagaries from the monk;<br /></span>
<span>Nor, in the devil ethics thou hast read,<br /></span>
<span>There spake the poet in the Devil's stead.<br /></span>
<span>Let Virtue be our helmet and our shield,<br /></span>
<span>And Truth our weapon&mdash;weapon sharp and strong<br /></span>
<span>And deadly to all error and all wrong.<br /></span>
<span>Yea, armed with Truth, though rogues and rascals throng<br /></span>
<span>The citadel of Virtue shall not yield,<br /></span>
<span>For God's right arm of Truth prevails in every field.<br /></span>

<a name='Footnote_2'></a><a href='#FNanchor_2'>[2]</a><div class='note'><p> One of the favorite and most exciting games of the Dakotas is
ball-playing. A smooth place on the prairie, or in winter, on a frozen
lake or river, is chosen. Each player has a sort of bat, called
&quot;<i>T&acirc;-k&eacute;e-cha-ps&eacute;-cha</i>,&quot; about thirty-two inches long, with a hoop at the
lower end four or five inches in diameter, interlaced with thongs of
deer-skin, forming a sort of pocket. With these bats they catch and
throw the ball. Stakes are set as bounds at a considerable distance from
the center on either side. Two parties are then formed and each chooses
a leader or chief. The ball (<i>T&acirc;pa</i>) is then thrown up half way between
the bounds, and the game begins, the contestants contending with their
bats for the ball as it falls. When one succeeds in getting it fairly
into the pocket of his bat he swings it aloft and throws it as far as he
can toward the bound to which his party is working, taking care to send
it if possible where some of his own side will take it up. Thus the ball
is thrown and contended for till one party succeeds in casting it beyond
the bounds of the opposite party. A hundred players en a side are
sometimes engaged in this exciting game. Betting on the result often
runs high. Moccasins, pipes, knives, hatchets, blankets, robes and guns
are hung on the prize-pole. Not unfrequently horses are staked on the
issue and sometimes even women. Old men and mothers are among the
spectators, praising their swift-footed sons, and young wives and
maidens are there to stimulate their husbands and lovers. This game is
not confined to the warriors but is also a favorite amusement of the
Dakota maidens, who generally play for prizes offered by the chief or
warriors. (See <i>Neill's Hist. Minn.</i>, pp 74-5; <i>Riggs' T&acirc;koo Wak&acirc;n</i>, pp

full Dakota name of the grandfather of the celebrated &quot;Little Crow&quot;
(<i>Ta-&oacute;-ya-te-d&uacute;-ta</i>&mdash;His Red People) who led his warriors in the
terrible outbreak in Minnesota in 1862-3. The Chippeways called the
grandfather <i>K&aacute;-k&aacute;-g&egrave;</i>&mdash;crow or raven&mdash;from his war-badge, a crow-skin;
and hence the French traders and <i>courriers du bois</i> called him &quot;<i>Petit
Corbeau</i>&quot;&mdash;Little Crow. This sobriquet, of which he was proud, descended
to his son, <i>Wakinyan T&acirc;nka</i>&mdash;Big Thunder, who succeeded him as chief;
and from Big Thunder to his son <i>Ta-&oacute;-ya-te-d&uacute;-ta</i>, who became chief on
the death of <i>Wakinyan T&acirc;nka</i>. These several &quot;Little Crows&quot; were
successively Chiefs of the Light-foot, or <i>Kap&oacute;za</i> band of Dakotas.
<i>Kap&oacute;za</i>, the principal village of this band, was originally located on
the east bank of the Mississippi near the site of the city of St. Paul.
<i>Col. Minn. Hist. Soc.</i>, 1864, p. 29. It was in later years moved to the
west bank. The grandfather whom I, for short, call <i>Wak&acirc;wa</i>, died the
death of a brave in battle against the Ojibways (commonly called
Chippeways)&mdash;the hereditary enemies of the Dakotas. <i>Wakinyan
T&acirc;nka</i>&mdash;Big Thunder, was killed by the accidental discharge of his own
gun. They were both buried with their kindred near the &quot;<i>Wakan Teepee</i>,&quot;
the sacred Cave&mdash;(Carver's Cave). <i>Ta-&oacute;-ya-te-d&uacute;-ta</i>, the last of the
Little Crows, was killed July 3, 1863, during the outbreak, near
Hutchinson, Minnesota, by the Lampsons&mdash;father and son, and his bones
were duly &quot;done up&quot; for the Historical Society of Minnesota. See
<i>Heard's Hist. Sioux War</i>, and <i>Neill's Hist. Minnesota</i>, Third Edition.</p>

<p>[Illustration: LITTLE CROW. <i>From an original photograph in the author's
possession</i>]</p>

<p>Little Crow's sixteen-year-old son, <i>Wa-wi-na-pe</i>&mdash;(One who appears
&mdash;like the spirit of his forefather) was with him at the time he was
killed; but escaped, and after much hardship and suffering, was at last
captured at <i>Mini Wakan</i> (Devil's Lake, in North Dakota). From him
personally I obtained much information in regard to Little Crow's
participation in the &quot;Sioux War,&quot; and minutely the speech that Little
Crow made to his braves when he finally consented to lead them on the
war-path against the whites. A literal translation of that speech will
be found further on in this note.</p>

<p>I knew <i>Ta-&oacute;-ya-te-d&uacute;-ta</i>, and from his own lips, in 1859-60 and 61,
obtained much interesting information in regard to the history,
tradition, customs, superstitions and habits of the Dakotas, of whom he
was the recognized Head-Chief. He was a remarkable Indian&mdash;a philosopher
and a brave and generous man. &quot;Untutored savage&quot; that he was, he was a
prince among his own people, and the peer in natural ability of the
ablest white men in the Northwest in his time. He had largely adopted
the dress and habits of civilized man, and he urged his people to
abandon their savage ways, build houses, cultivate fields, and learn to
live like the white people. He clearly forsaw the ultimate extinction of
his people as a distinct race. He well knew and realized the numbers and
power of the whites then rapidly taking possession of the
hunting-grounds of the Dakotas, and the folly of armed opposition on the
part of his people. He said to me once: &quot;No more Dakotas by and by;
Indians all white men. No more buffaloes by and by; all cows, all oxen.&quot;
But his braves were restless. They smarted under years of wrong and
robbery, to which, indeed, the most stinging insults were often added by
the traders and officials among them. If the true, unvarnished history
of the cause and inception of the &quot;Sioux Outbreak&quot; in Minnesota is ever
written and published, it will bring the blush of shame to the cheeks of
every honest man who reads it.</p>

<p>Against his judgment and repeated protests, Little Crow was at last,
after the depredations had begun, forced into the war on the whites by
his hot-headed and uncontrollable &quot;young men.&quot;</p>

<p>Goaded to desperation, a party of Little Crow's young &quot;bucks,&quot; in
August, 1862, began their depredations and spilled white blood at Acton.
Returning to their chief's camp near the agency, they told their fellow
braves what they had done. The hot-headed young warriors immediately
demanded of Little Crow that he put on the &quot;war-paint&quot; and lead them
against the white men. The chief severely rebuked the &quot;young men&quot; who
had committed the murders, blackened his face (a sign of mourning),
retired to his <i>teepee</i> and covered his head in sorrow.</p>

<p>His braves surrounded his tent and cut it into strips with their knives.
They threatened to depose him from the chiefship unless he immediately
put on the &quot;war-paint&quot; and led them against the whites. They knew that
the Civil War was then in progress, that the white men were fighting
among themselves, and they declared that now was the time to regain
their lost hunting-grounds; that now was the time to avenge the thievery
and insults of the Agents who had for years systematically cheated them
out of the greater part of their promised annuities, for which they had
been induced to part with their lands; that now was the time to avenge
the debauchery of their wives and daughters by the dissolute hangers-on
who, as employees of the Indian Agents and licensed traders, had for
years hovered around them like buzzards around the carcasses of
slaughtered buffaloes.</p>

<p>But Little Crow was unmoved by the appeals and threats of his warriors.
It is said that once for a moment he uncovered his head; that his face
was haggard and great beads of sweat stood out on his forehead. But at
last one of his enraged braves, bolder than the rest, cried out:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Ta-&oacute;-ya-te-d&uacute;-ta</i> is a coward!&quot;</p>

<p>Instantly Little Crow sprang from his <i>teepee</i>, snatched the
eagle-feathers from the head of his insulter and flung them on the
ground. Then, stretching himself to his full height, his eyes flashing
fire, and in a voice tremulous with rage, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Ta-&oacute;-ya-te-d&uacute;-ta</i> is not a coward, and he is not a fool! When did he
run away from his enemies? When did he leave his braves behind him on
the war-path and turn back to his <i>teepees</i>? When he ran away from your
enemies, he walked behind on your trail with his face to the Ojibways
and covered your backs as a she-bear covers her cubs! Is
<i>Ta-&oacute;-ya-te-d&uacute;-ta</i> without scalps? Look at his war-feathers! Behold the
scalp-locks of your enemies hanging there on his lodge-poles! Do they
call him a coward? <i>Ta-&oacute;-ya-te-d&uacute;-ta</i> is not a coward, and he is not a
fool. Braves, you are like little children; you know not what you are
doing.</p>

<p>&quot;You are full of the white man's <i>devil-water</i>&quot; (rum). &quot;You are like
dogs in the Hot Moon when they run mad and snap at their own shadows. We
are only little herds of buffaloes left scattered; the great herds that
once covered the prairies are no more. See!&mdash;the white men are like the
locusts when they fly so thick that the whole sky is a snow-storm. You
may kill one&mdash;two&mdash;ten; yes, as many as the leaves in the forest
yonder, and their brothers will not miss them. Kill one&mdash;two&mdash;ten, and
ten times ten will come to kill you. Count your fingers all day long and
white men with guns in their hands will come faster than you can count.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; they fight among themselves&mdash;away off. Do you hear the thunder of
their big guns? No; it would take you two moons to run down to where
they are fighting, and all the way your path would be among white
soldiers as thick as tamaracks in the swamps of the Ojibways. Yes; they
fight among themselves, but if you strike at them they will all turn on
you and devour you and your women and little children just as the
locusts in their time fall on the trees and devour all the leaves in one
day. You are fools. You cannot see the face of your chief; your eyes are
full of smoke. You cannot hear his voice; your ears are full of roaring
waters. Braves, you are little children&mdash;you are fools. You will die
like the rabbits when the hungry wolves hunt them in the Hard Moon
(January). <i>Ta-&oacute;-ya-t&eacute; d&uacute;-ta</i> is not a coward: he will die with you.&quot;</p></div>

contraction of <i>W&acirc;-pa-h&acirc;-sa</i>, which is from <i>W&acirc;-ha-pa</i>, the standard or
pole used in the Dakota dances and upon which feathers of various colors
are tied, and not from <i>W&acirc;-pa</i>&mdash;leaf, as has been generally supposed.
Therefore <i>W&acirc;pasa</i> means the Standard&mdash;and not the &quot;Leaf-Shaker,&quot; as
many writers have it. The principal village of these hereditary chiefs
was <i>Ke-&uacute;k-sa</i>, or <i>Ke-&oacute;-sa</i>,&mdash;where now stands the fair city of Winona.
<i>Ke-&uacute;k-sa</i> signifies&mdash;The village of law-breakers; so called because
this band broke the law or custom of the Dakotas against marrying blood

a Dakota &quot;Helen&quot; was the cause of the separation and a bloody feud that
lasted for many years. The <i>H&oacute;h&eacute;s</i> are called &quot;Stone-roasters,&quot; because,
until recently at least, they used <i>wa-ta-pe</i> kettles and vessels made
of birch bark in which they cooked their food. They boiled water in
these vessels by heating stones and putting them in the water. The
<i>wa-ta-pe</i> kettle is made of the fibrous roots of the white cedar

is universally feared and reverenced by the Dakotas, but so severe is
the ordeal that the <i>Hey&oacute;ka Wacipee</i> (the dance to <i>Hey&oacute;ka</i>) is now
rarely celebrated. It is said that the &quot;Medicine-men&quot; use a secret
preparation which enables them to handle fire and dip their hands in
boiling water without injury and thereby gain great <i>eclat</i> from the

There are many Thunder-birds. The father of all the
Thunder-birds&mdash;&quot;<i>Wakinyan Tanka</i>&quot;&mdash;or &quot;Big Thunder,&quot; has his <i>teepee</i> on
a lofty mountain in the far West. His <i>teepee</i> has four openings, at

bear; at the south, a red deer; at the north, a caribou. He has a bitter
enmity against <i>Unkt&eacute;hee</i> (god of waters) and often shoots his fiery
arrows at him, and hits the earth, trees, rocks, and sometimes men.
<i>Wakinyan</i> created wild-rice, the bow and arrow, the tomahawk and the
spear. He is a great war-spirit, and <i>Wanmd&eacute;e</i> (the war-eagle) is his

of an amazing depth. The Indians term it Wakonteebe, that is, the
Dwelling of the Great Spirit. The entrance into it is about ten feet
wide, the height of it five feet, the arch within is near fifteen feet
high and about thirty feet broad. The bottom of it consists of fine
clear sand. About twenty feet from the entrance begins a lake, the water
of which is transparent, and extends to an unsearchable distance; for
the darkness of the cave prevents all attempts to acquire a knowledge of
it. I threw a small pebble toward the interior parts of it with my
utmost strength. I could hear that it fell into the water, and
notwithstanding it was of so small a size it caused an astonishing and
horrible noise that reverberated through all those gloomy regions. I
found in this cave many Indian hieroglyphics which appeared very
ancient, for time had nearly covered them with moss so that it was with
difficulty I could trace them. They were cut in a rude manner upon the
inside of the walls, which were composed of a stone so extremely soft
that it might be easily penetrated with a knife: a stone everywhere to
be found near the Mississippi. This cave is only accessible by ascending
a narrow, steep passage that lies near the brink of the river. At a
little distance from this dreary cavern is the burying-place of several
bands of the Naudowessie (Dakota) Indians,&quot; Many years ago the roof fell
in but the cave has been partly restored and is now used as a beer
cellar.</p></div>

fashioned the earth into a large circular plain. The earth being
finished he took a deity, one of his own offspring, and, grinding him to
powder, sprinkled it upon the earth, and this produced many worms. The
worms were then collected and scattered again. They matured into infants
and these were then collected and scattered and became full-grown

student of Dakota customs, superstitions, etc., says, T&acirc;hkoo Wahkan, p.

such. It is in an intangible, mysterious something of which they are
only the embodiment, and that in such measure and degree as may accord
with the individual fancy of the worshiper. Each one will worship some
of these divinities, and neglect or despise others, but the great object
of all their worship, whatever its chosen medium, is the <i>Ta-koo
Wa-kan</i>, which is the supernatural and mysterious. No one term can
express the full meaning of the Dakota's <i>Wakan</i>. It comprehends all
mystery, secret power and divinity. Awe and reverence are its due, and
it is as unlimited in manifestation as it is in idea. All life is
<i>Wakan</i>; so also is everything which exhibits power, whether in action,
as the winds and drifting clouds; or in passive endurance, as the
boulder by the wayside. For even the commonest sticks and stones have a
spiritual essence which must be reverenced as a manifestation of the
all-pervading, mysterious power that fills the universe.&quot;</p></div>

called the Falls of Minnehaha &quot;<i>Mini-i-hrpa-ya-dan</i>,&quot; and it had no
other name in Dakota. &quot;It means Little Falls and nothing else.&quot; Letter

<a name='Footnote_77'></a><a href='#FNanchor_77'>[77]</a><div class='note'><p> The game of the Plum-stones is one of the favorite games of the
Dakotas. Hennepin was the first to describe this game, in his
<i>Description de la Louisiane</i>, Paris, 1683, and he describes it very
accurately. See Shea's translation p. 301. The Dakotas call this game
<i>Kan-soo Koo-tay-pe</i>&mdash;shooting plum-stones. Each stone is painted black
on one side and red on the other; on one side they grave certain figures
which make the stones <i>Wakan</i>. They are placed in a dish and thrown up
like dice. Indeed, the game is virtually a game of dice. Hennepin says:
&quot;There are some so given to this game that they will gamble away even
their great coat. Those who conduct the game cry at the top of their
voices when they rattle the platter, and they strike their shoulders so
hard as to leave them all black with the blows.&quot;</p></div>

<a name='Footnote_81'></a><a href='#FNanchor_81'>[81]</a><div class='note'><p> The <i>Wic&acirc;st&acirc;pi Wak&acirc;npi</i> (literally, <i>men supernatural</i>) are the
&quot;Medicine-men&quot; or Magicians of the Dakotas. They call themselves the
sons or disciples of <i>Unkt&eacute;hee</i>. In their rites, ceremonies, tricks and
pretensions they closely resemble the <i>Dactyli, Id&aelig;</i>, and <i>Curetes</i> of
the ancient Greeks and Romans, the <i>Magi</i> of the Persians and the Druids
of Britain. Their pretended intercourse with spirits, their powers of
magic and divination, and their rites are substantially the same, and
point unmistakably to a common origin. The Dakota &quot;Medicine-Man&quot; can do
the &quot;rope trick&quot; of the Hindoo magician to perfection. The <i>teepee</i> used
for the <i>Wakan Wacipee</i>&mdash;or Sacred Dance&mdash;is called the <i>Wakan
Teepee</i>&mdash;the Sacred Teepee. Carvers Cave at St. Paul was also called
<i>Wakan Teepee</i> because the Medicine-men or magicians often held their
dances and feasts in it. For a full account of the rites, etc., see
Riggs' <i>Tahkoo Wahkan</i>, Chapter VI. The <i>Ta-sha-ke</i>&mdash;literally,
&quot;Deer-hoofs&quot;&mdash;is a rattle made by hanging the hard segments of
deer-hoofs to a wooden rod a foot long&mdash;about an inch in diameter at the
handle end, and tapering to a point at the other. The clashing of these
horny bits makes a sharp, shrill sound something like distant
sleigh-bells. In their incantations over the sick they sometimes use the
gourd shell rattle.</p>

<p>The <i>Ch&acirc;n-che-ga</i>&mdash;is a drum or &quot;Wooden Kettle.&quot; The hoop of the drum is
from a foot to eighteen inches in diameter, and from three to ten inches
deep. The skin covering is stretched over one end, making a drum with
one end only. The magical drum-sticks are ornamented with down, and
heads of birds or animals are carved on them. This makes them <i>Wakan</i>.</p>

<p>The flute called <i>Cho-tanka</i> (big pith) is of two varieties&mdash;one made of
sumac, the pith of which is punched out. The second variety is made of
the long bone of the wing or thigh of the swan or crane. They call the
first the <i>bubbling chotanka</i> from the tremulous note it gives when
blown with all the holes stopped. Riggs' <i>T&acirc;hkoo Wahkan</i>, p. 476, et
seq.</p>

<p><i>E-n&eacute;-pee</i>&mdash;vapor-bath, is used as a purification preparatory to the
sacred feasts. The vapor-bath is taken in this way: &quot;A number of poles,
the size of hoop-poles or less, are taken, and their larger ends being
set in the ground in a circle, the flexible tops are bent over and tied
in the center. This frame-work is then covered with robes and blankets,
a small hole being left on one side for an entrance. Before the door a
fire is built, and round stones about the size of a man's head, are
heated in it. When hot they are rolled within, and the door being closed
steam is made by pouring water on them. The devotee, stripped to the
skin, sits within this steam-tight dome, sweating profusely at every
pore, until he is nearly suffocated. Sometimes a number engage in it
together and unite their prayers and songs.&quot; <i>T&acirc;hkoo Wakan</i>, p. 83.
Father Hennepin was subjected to the vapor-bath at Mille Lacs by Chief
<i>Aqui-pa-que-tin</i>, two hundred years ago. After describing the method,
Hennepin says: &quot;When he had made me sweat thus three times in a week, I
felt as strong as ever.&quot; Shea's Hennepin, p. 228. For a very full and
accurate account of the Medicine-men of the Dakotas, and their rites,
etc., see Chap. II, Neill's Hist. Minnesota.</p></div>

the otter, the coon, the weasel, the squirrel, the loon, a certain kind
of fish or the skins of serpents. It must contain four kinds of medicine
(or magic) representing birds, beasts, herbs and trees, viz.: The down
of the female swan colored red, the roots of certain grasses, bark from
the roots of cedar trees, and hair of the buffalo. &quot;From this
combination proceeds a Wak&acirc;n influence so powerful that no human being,
unassisted, can resist it.&quot; Wonderful indeed must be the magic power of
these Dakota Druids to lead such a man as the Rev. S.R. Riggs to say of
them: &quot;By great shrewdness, untiring industry, and more or less of
<i>actual demoniacal possession</i>, they convince great numbers of their
fellows, and in the process are convinced themselves of their sacred
character and office.&quot; <i>T&acirc;hkoo Wak&acirc;n</i>, pp. 88-9.</p></div>

huge wings and makes the Thunder. From this mountain he sends forth the
rain, the snow, the hail, the lightning and the tempest. A vast giant,
turned to stone by his magic, lies asleep at his feet. The island called
by the Ojibways the <i>Mak-i-nak</i> (the turtle) from its tortoise-like
shape, lifts its huge form in the distance. Some &quot;down-east Yankee&quot;

probably the first priest at this point. After he was lost in the
wilderness, Father Glaude Allou&euml;z permanently established the mission in
1665. The famous Father Marquette, who took Allou&euml;z's place, Sept. 13,
1669, writing to his superior, thus describes the Dakotas: &quot;The
Nadouessi are the Iroquois of this country, beyond La Pointe, <i>but less
faithless, and never attack till attacked.</i> Their language is entirely
different from the Huron and Algonquin. They have many villages but are
widely scattered. They have very extraordinary customs. They principally
use the calumet. They do not speak at great feasts, and when a stranger
arrives give him to eat of a wooden fork, as we would a child. All the
lake tribes make war on them, but with small success. They have false
oats (wild rice,) use little canoes, <i>and keep their word strictly</i>.&quot;

<a name='Footnote_86'></a><a href='#FNanchor_86'>[86]</a><div class='note'><p> Pronounced <i>Kah-th&aacute;h-gah</i>&mdash;literally, <i>the place of waves and foam</i>.
This was the principal village of the <i>Isantee</i> band of Dakotas two
hundred years ago, and was located at the Falls of St. Anthony, which
the Dakotas called the <i>Ha-ha</i>,&mdash;pronounced <i>Rhah-rhah</i>,&mdash;the
<i>loud-laughing waters</i>. The Dakotas believed that the Falls were in the
center of the earth. Here dwelt the <i>Great Unkt&eacute;hee</i>, the creator of the
earth and man: and from this place a path led to the Spirit-land. DuLuth
undoubtedly visited Kath&acirc;ga in the year 1679. In his &quot;Memoir&quot; (Archives
of the Ministry of the Marine) addressed to Seignelay, 1685, he says:
&quot;On the 2nd of July, 1679, I had the honor to plant his Majesty's arms
in the great village of the Nadouecioux called Izatys, where never had a
Frenchman been, etc.&quot; <i>Izatys</i> is here used not as the name of the
village, but as the name of the band&mdash;the <i>Isantees</i>. <i>Nadouecioux</i> was
a name given the Dakotas generally by the early French traders and the
Ojibways. See <i>Shea's Hennepin's Description of Louisiana</i>, pp. 203 and
375. The villages of the Dakotas were not permanent towns. They were
hardly more than camping grounds, occupied at intervals and for longer
or shorter periods, as suited the convenience of the hunters; yet there
were certain places, like Mille Lacs, the Falls of St. Anthony, <i>Kapoza</i>
(near St. Paul), <i>Remnica</i> (where the city of Red Wing now stands), and
<i>Keuxa</i> (or <i>Keoza</i>) on the site of the city of Winona, so frequently
occupied by several of the bands as to be considered their chief
villages respectively.</p>

<p>Mr. Neill, usually very accurate and painstaking, has fallen into an
error in his prefatory notes to the last edition of his valuable
<i>History of Minnesota</i>. Speaking of DuLuth, he says:</p>

<p>&quot;He appears to have entered Minnesota by way of the Pigeon or St. Louis
River, and to have explored where no Frenchman had been, and on July 2,
1679, was at <i>Kathio</i> (<i>Kath&acirc;ga</i>) perhaps on Red Lake or Lake of the
Woods, which was called 'the great village of the Wadouessioux,' one
hundred and twenty leagues from the <i>Songaskicons</i> and <i>Houetepons</i> who
were dwellers <i>in the Mille Lac region</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>Now <i>Kath&acirc;ga</i> (Mr. Neill's <i>Kathio</i>) was located at the Falls of St.
Anthony on the Mississippi as the whole current of Dakota traditions
clearly shows and DuLuth's dispatches clearly indicate. Besides, the
<i>Songaskicons</i> and <i>Houetepons</i> were <i>not</i> and never were &quot;dwellers in
the Mille Lac region.&quot; The Songaskicons (Sissetons) were at that time
located on the Des Moines river (in Iowa), and the Houetabons
(Ouadebatons) at and around Big Stone Lake. The Isantees occupied the
region lying between the mouth of the Minnesota River and Spirit Lake
(Mille Lacs) with their principal village&mdash;<i>Kath&aacute;ga</i>&mdash;where the city of
Minneapolis now stands. These facts account for the &quot;one hundred and
twenty leagues&quot; as distances were roughly reckoned by the early French
explorers.</p>

<p>September 1, 1678, Daniel Greysolon DuLuth, a native of Lyons, France,
left Quebec to explore the country of the Dakotas. &quot;The next year (1679)
on the 2nd day of July, he caused the king's arms to be planted in the
great village of the Nadouessioux (Dakotas) called Kathio&quot; (<i>Kath&aacute;ga</i>)
&quot;where no Frenchman had ever been, also at the Songaskicons and
Houetabons, one hundred and twenty leagues distant from the former. * *
* * On this tour he visited Mille Lacs, which he called Lake Buade, the
family name of Frontenac, governor of Canada.&quot; <i>Neill''s History of
Minnesota</i>, p. 122. This is correct, except the name of the
village&mdash;<i>Kathio</i>, which is a misprint or perhaps an error of a copyist.
It should be <i>Kath&aacute;ga</i>. DuLuth was again at the Falls of St. Anthony in
1680 and returned to Lake Superior via the Mississippi, Rum River and
Mille Lacs, according to his own dispatches.</p>

<p>Franquelin's &quot;<i>Carte de la Louisiane</i>&quot; printed at Paris A.D. 1684, from
information derived from DuLuth, who visited France in 1682-3, and
conferred with the minister of the Colonies and the minister of
Marine&mdash;shows the inaccuracy, as to points of compass at least, of the
early French explorers. According to this map, Lake Buade (Mille Lacs)
lies north-west of Lake Superior and Lake Pepin lies due west of it.</p>

<p>DuLuth was afterward appointed to the command of Fort Frontenac near
Niagara Falls, and died there in 1710. The official dispatch from the
Governor of Canada to the French Government is, as regards the great
explorer, brief and expressive&mdash;&quot;Captain DuLuth is dead. He was an
honest man.&quot;</p>

<p>To Daniel Greysolon DuLuth, and not to Father Hennepin, whom he rescued
from his captors at Mille Lacs, belongs the credit of the first
exploration of Minnesota by white men.</p>

<p>Father Hennepin was a self-conceited and self-convicted liar. Daniel
Greysolon DuLuth &quot;was an honest man.&quot;</p></div>

into verse&quot; by Longfellow in <i>Hiawatha</i>. Longfellow evidently took his
version from Schoolcraft. I took mine originally from the lips of
<i>Pah-go-nay-gie-shiek</i>&mdash;&quot;Hole-in-the-day&quot;&mdash;(the elder) in his day
head-chief of the Ojibways. I afterward submitted it to <i>Gitche
Shab&aacute;sh-Konk</i>, head-chief of the <i>Misse-sah-ga-&eacute;-gun</i>&mdash;(Mille Lacs band
of Ojibways), who pronounced it correct.</p>
<p>&quot;Hole-in-the-day,&quot; although sanctioned by years of unchallenged use, is
a bad translation of <i>Pah-go-nay-gie-shiek</i>, which means a <i>clear spot
in the sky</i>.</p><p>[Illustration: HOLE-IN-THE-DAY. <i>From an original photograph in the
author's possession.</i>]</p>

<p>He was a very intelligent man; had been in Washington several times on
business connected with his people, and was always shrewd enough to
look out for himself in all his treaties and transactions with the
Government. He stood six feet two inches in his moccasins, was
well-proportioned, and had a remarkably fine face. He had a
nickname&mdash;<i>Que-we-z&aacute;nc</i>&mdash;(Little Boy) by which he was familiarly called
by his people.</p>

<p>The Pillagers&mdash;<i>Nah-k&aacute;nd-tway-we-nin-ni-wak</i>&mdash;who live about Leech Lake
(<i>Kah-sah-gah-squah-g-me-cock</i>) were opposed to <i>Pa-go-nay-gie-shiek</i>,
but he compelled them through fear to recognize him as Head-Chief. At
the time of the &quot;Sioux outbreak&quot; in 1862 &quot;Hole-in-the-day&quot; for a time
apparently meditated an alliance with the <i>Po-&aacute;h-nuck</i> (Dakotas) and war
upon the whites. The Pillagers and some other bands urged him strongly
to this course, and his supremacy as head-chief was threatened unless he
complied. Messengers from the Dakotas were undoubtedly received by him,
and he, for a time at least, led the Dakotas to believe that their
hereditary enemies, the Ojibways, would bury the hatchet and join them
in a war of extermination against the whites. &quot;Hole-in-the-day,&quot; with a
band of his warriors, appeared opposite Fort Ripley (situated on the
west bank of the Mississippi River between Little Falls and Crow Wing),
and assumed a threatening attitude toward the fort, then garrisoned by
volunteer troops. The soldiers were drawn up on the right bank and
&quot;Hole-in-the-day&quot; and his warriors on the left. A little speech-making
settled the matter for the time being and very soon thereafter a new
treaty was made with &quot;Hole-in-the-day&quot; and his head men, by which their
friendship and allegiance were secured to the whites. It was claimed by
the Pillagers that &quot;Hole-in-the-day&quot; seized the occasion to profit
personally in his negotiations with the agents of the Government.</p>

<p>In 1867 &quot;Hole-in-the-day&quot; took &quot;another wife.&quot; He married Helen McCarty,
a white woman, in Washington, D.C., and took her to his home at Gull
Lake (<i>Ka-ga-ya-sk&uacute;nc-cock</i>) literally, <i>plenty of little gulls</i>.</p>

<p>She bore him a son who is known as Joseph H. Woodbury, and now (1891)
resides in the city of Minneapolis. His marriage with a white woman
increased the hatred of the Pillagers, and they shot him from ambush and
killed him near <i>Ninge-t&aacute;-we-de-gu&aacute;-yonk</i>&mdash;Crow Wing&mdash;on the 27th day of
June, 1868.</p>

<p>At the time of his death, &quot;Hole-in-the-day&quot; was only thirty-seven years
old but had been recognized as Head-Chief for a long time. He could
speak some English, and was far above the average of white men in
native shrewdness and intelligence. He was thoroughly posted in the
traditions and legends of his people.</p>

<p>The Ojibways have for many years been cursed by contact with the worst
elements of the whites, and seem to have adopted the vices rather than
the virtues of civilization. I once spoke of this to &quot;Hole-in-the-day.&quot;
His reply was terse and truthful&mdash;&quot;<i>M&aacute;dg&egrave; tche-m&oacute;-ko-mon, m&aacute;dg&egrave;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
